"Hemophilia, which means love (philia) of blood (hemo), manifests with prolonged and excessive bleeding either spontaneously or after insignificant trauma. Hemophilia encompasses a group of inherited ailments that alter the body's normal blood coagulation. A hereditary hemorrhagic disorder resulting from congenital deficit or scarcity of factor VIII, hemophilia A, which is known as classical hemophilia, manifests as protracted and excessive bleeding either spontaneously or secondary to trauma.",/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/data/hemophilia/datasets/hemophilia.txt,What is hemophilia?,"Hemophilia is a group of bleeding disorders characterized by a deficiency of one of the factors necessary for blood coagulation, resulting in prolonged and excessive bleeding after minor trauma or sometimes even spontaneously. The most common subtypes are hemophilia A, or factor VIII deficiency, and hemophilia B, or factor IX deficiency. It is a hereditary disorder that can result in joint hemorrhage and requires a comprehensive approach coordinated by a multidisciplinary team of specialists for optimal long-term results. Hemophilia has often been called “the disease of the kings” and was first documented in ancient history and modern history by various physicians.","Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to form blood clots, leading to excessive bleeding and bruising.

"The most common inherited bleeding disorder in man, haemophilia A, is caused by defect in factor VIII, a component in the blood coagulation pathway. The X-chromosome-linked disease almost certainly stems from a heterogeneous collection of genetic lesions. Because, without proper treatment, haemophilia can be a fatal disease, new mutations are necessary to account for its constant frequency in the population. In addition, haemophilia A displays a wide range of severity, and some 15% of haemophiliacs generate high levels of antibodies against factor VIII ('inhibitor patients'). The present work elucidates the molecular genetic basis of haemophilia in some individuals. Using the recently cloned factor VIII gene as a probe, we have identified two different nonsense point mutations in the factor VIII gene of haemophiliacs, as well as two different partial deletions of the gene. Our survey of 92 haemophiliacs indicates no firm correlation between antibody (inhibitor) production and gross gene defects.",/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/data/hemophilia/datasets/hemophilia.txt,What causes hemophilia?,"Hemophilia is caused by a deficiency or abnormality of coagulation factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B), which are X-chromosome linked mutations.",Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that is caused by a deficiency in clotting factors in the blood.,gpt3.5_turbo,full_abstracts.txt,chroma
"Carriers of hemophilia have a 50% chance of giving birth to a hemophilic son. Approximately 35% may have a lower than normal factor VIII or IX and therefore can be diagnosed without genetic testing. These individuals may present with menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia and dysmenorrhoea. The treatment of menorrhagia is similar to girls without bleeding disorders--tranexamic acid, the oral contraceptive pill and, where acceptable, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device. Genetic diagnosis is possible for potential carriers--50% families with severe hemophilia carry the intron 22 inversion and databases are available which list most of the causative mutations for hemophilia A and B.

"Hemophilia is derived from hemo (blood) and philia (love), is recognized as the most common and severe hemorrhagic disorder. Depending upon the pathophysiology, there are three types of hemophilia -A, B, and C, caused by the deficiency or dysfunction of factors VIII, IX, and XI, respectively. It can be hereditary, which is more common, and a rare variety is the acquired one. Acquired hemophilia is due to the autoantibodies that develop against a coagulation factor. Mostly the antibodies develop against the factor VIII, hence commonly known as ""acquired hemophilia A"" (AHA). Patients with autoantibodies may present with catastrophic bleeding; they usually do not have any past medical history of bleeding episodes or disorder. Its diagnosis is often difficult because of its rarity and the complexity of the laboratory workup.

"A diagnosis of hemophilia A or hemophilia B begins with clinical assessment of the patient and is facilitated by laboratory testing. The influence of the latter on a diagnosis of hemophilia A or hemophilia B is clear-a diagnosis cannot be made without laboratory confirmation of a deficiency of factor FVIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), respectively. Moreover, the degree of hemophilia severity is specifically characterized by laboratory test results. In turn, patient management, including choice and application of therapies, is influenced by the diagnosis, as well as by identification of respective disease severity. An incorrect diagnosis may lead to inappropriate management and unnecessary therapy, and thus to adverse outcomes.

Living close to a haemophilia centre, proper counselling at the centre and awareness of the availability of prenatal diagnostic tests influenced the women's decision to become pregnant in 14% and 10% of first and subsequent pregnancies, respectively. These factors were considered more frequently in women with severe haemophilia in the family (P = 0.002) and in confirmed carriers of haemophilia (P = 0.04). When women made a conscious decision not to have children, the reasons were fear of passing haemophilia onto their child (44%), previous experience with haemophilia (6%) and the stress of going through prenatal tests (7%). Severity of the disease in the family, haemophilia diagnosis, results of DNA studies, religion and year of birth had no effect on this decision.

"Factor VIII (FVIII), an essential blood coagulation protein, is a key component of the fluid phase blood coagulation system. Human factor VIII is a single chain of about 300 kDa consisting of domains described as A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. The protein undergoes processing prior to secretion into blood resulting in a heavy chain of 200 kDa (A1-A2-B) and a light chain of 80 kDa (A3-C1-C2) linked by metal ions. The role of factor VIII is to increase the catalytic efficiency of factor IXa in the activation of factor X.

"For decades, the monogenetic bleeding disorders hemophilia A and B (coagulation factor VIII and IX deficiency) have been treated with systemic protein replacement therapy. Now, diverse molecular medicines, ranging from antibody to gene to RNA therapy, are transforming treatment. Traditional replacement therapy requires twice to thrice weekly intravenous infusions of factor. While extended half-life products may reduce the frequency of injections, patients continue to face a lifelong burden of the therapy, suboptimal protection from bleeding and joint damage, and potential development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (inhibitors) that require less efficacious bypassing agents and further reduce quality of life. Novel non-replacement and gene therapies aim to address these remaining issues. A recently approved factor VIII-mimetic antibody accomplishes hemostatic correction in patients both with and without inhibitors. Antibodies against tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) target natural anticoagulant pathways to rebalance hemostasis. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy provides lasting clotting factor replacement and can also be used to induce immune tolerance.

"The risk of pathogen transmission via clotting factor therapies has been reduced over the last two decades through the development of effective and progressively more sensitive pathogen screening and inactivation methods and the introduction of recombinant clotting factors for hemophilia, beginning with recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) in 1992. However, new understanding about the potential for transmission of an emerging infectious agent through blood and blood products has renewed concerns about vulnerabilities that remain in plasma-derived and some recombinant clotting therapies that still use plasma components during some stages of the manufacturing process. In the 1980s, patients with hemophilia became ""canaries in the coal mine"" for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the blood supply. Moving forward, healthcare providers must continue to take a proactive role in educating themselves about new information regarding emerging pathogens and develop approaches to discussing this risk with their patients as part of their therapy selection process.",/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/data/hemophilia/datasets/hemophilia.txt,What are the risks associated with clotting factor replacement therapy?,"The risks associated with clotting factor replacement therapy include the potential for transmission of emerging infectious agents through blood and blood products, as well as the development of inhibitors as a frequent complication.

"Inhibitor formation is among the most severe complications of hemophilia treatment. With a cumulative incidence of ∼30% in those with severe hemophilia A and ∼3% in those with severe hemophilia B, inhibitors are caused by a T-cell response directed against infused coagulation factor; these inhibitors neutralize factor VIII or IX activity and disrupt normal hemostasis. Inhibitor patients become unresponsive to standard factor treatment and, as an alternative, use bypass treatment (eg, recombinant factor VIIa or factor VIII inhibitor bypass activity). However, response to bypass agents is poorer and the burden of disease is higher, with greater morbidity, hospitalization, cost, and mortality, than in noninhibitor patients. Furthermore, inhibitor formation interferes with prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes and is a contraindication to gene therapy. Thus, more effective therapies for inhibitor patients are greatly needed. In the last several years, there has been an explosion of novel alternative hemostatic agents for hemophilia patients with and without inhibitors. These agents take advantage of technologic manipulation of coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants to promote hemostasis. The approaches include the following: (1) mutants or mimics of coagulation factors, rendering them resistant to natural anticoagulants; or (2) knock-down or disruption of natural anticoagulants, preventing degradation of coagulation factors. The purpose of this article was to review these novel alternative hemostatic agents and their mechanisms of action, as well as the preliminary pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy data available from early-phase clinical trials.",/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/data/hemophilia/datasets/hemophilia.txt,What is an inhibitor in hemophilia?,"An inhibitor in hemophilia is a neutralizing anti-drug antibody that is developed in response to infused coagulation factor, which disrupts normal hemostasis and renders standard hemostatic therapy ineffective.

"Gene therapy has the potential to revolutionise treatment for patients with haemophilia and is close to entering clinical practice. While factor concentrates have improved outcomes, individuals still face a lifetime of injections, pain, progressive joint damage, the potential for inhibitor development and impaired quality of life. Recently published studies in adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene therapy have demonstrated improvement in endogenous factor levels over sustained periods, significant reduction in annualised bleed rates, lower exogenous factor usage and thus far a positive safety profile. In making the shared decision to proceed with gene therapy for haemophilia, physicians should make it clear that research is ongoing and that there are remaining evidence gaps, such as long-term safety profiles and duration of treatment effect. The eligibility criteria for gene therapy trials mean that key patient groups may be excluded, eg children/adolescents, those with liver or kidney dysfunction and those with a prior history of factor inhibitors or pre-existing neutralising AAV antibodies. Gene therapy offers a life-changing opportunity for patients to reduce their bleeding risk while also reducing or abrogating the need for exogenous factor administration.

It is important to manage patient expectations, particularly regarding activity levels and bleed risk in the immediate post-treatment period.","Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot. Gene therapy is a potential treatment for hemophilia that involves introducing a functional copy of the faulty gene into the patient's cells. However, there are potential risks associated with gene therapy, such as immune reactions to the viral vectors used to deliver the gene, unintended mutations in the patient's DNA, and the possibility of the therapy not working as intended. Additionally, there is a risk of the therapy being too effective and causing excessive clotting, which can lead to serious health complications.

"Hemophilia is a congenital hemorrhagic disease caused by genetic abnormalities in coagulation factor VIII or factor IX. Current conventional therapy to prevent bleeding requires frequent intravenous injections of coagulation factor concentrates from early childhood. Accordingly, gene therapy for hemophilia remains an exciting future prospect for patients and their families, due to its potential to cure the disease through a one-time treatment. After a series of successes in basic research, recent clinical trials have demonstrated clear efficacy of gene therapy for hemophilia using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Although this is likely to alter the paradigm of hemophilia care in the near future, it will be important to overcome immune responses against AAV. Gene therapy for hemophilia cannot be given to patients with anti-AAV capsid-neutralizing antibodies, and cellular immunity with CD8(+) T cells should be controlled for sustained expression. Furthermore, long-term therapeutic effects should be closely observed because of the failure of the AAV vector genome to replicate during cell division.

"Von Willebrand's disease is probably the most common congenital bleeding disorder, with a prevalence close to 1% in some epidemiological studies.

The size of multimers ranges from approximately 500 kDa to 20 MDa. Each subunit consist of repeated domain structures. Several functional domains have been identified which can bind such structures as platelet receptors glycoprotein Ib or IIb/IIIA, heparin, collagen or factor VIII.

"The clinical picture, family history and laboratory findings of 100 patients with von Willebrand's disease (VWD) have been studied in Italy in a multicentre survey from two rural areas with a known high incidence of the disease and from two large cities (Rome and Milan). Bleeding time, procoagulant factor-VIII (VIIIAHF) assay, platelet retention and PRP-ristocetin aggregation were measured in each centre, and plasma samples were frozen and subsequently assayed for factor VIII-related antigen (VIIIAGN) and ristocetin co-factor (VIIIVWF) in one laboratory (Milan). On the basis of the inheritance pattern, clinical severity of the disease and laboratory findings, patients with VWD were separated into two groups. In 17 patients the absence of a family history of bleeding, a high incidence of parental consanguinity and involvement of both sexes suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance; the unusual severity of the disease with markedly abnormal results of all six laboratory measurements (and frequent reduced levels of VIIIAGN and VIIIVWF in the unaffected parents) were consistent with the homozygous state. In 83 patients, the disease was familial (being transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait) and of moderate clinical severity. In these, VIIIVWF was usually much lower than VIIIAHF and VIIIAGN.

"The von Willebrand's Disease affects about 1-3 % of the population and it is undiagnosed in most people. Originally described by the Finish physician Erik von Willebrand in 1926 this disorder is associated with mucous membran bleeding including epistaxis, hypermenorhoea and excessive bleeding from surgery and dental procedures. In von Willebrands disease the patients have a quantitative or qualitative abnormality in the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) which has two major functions: it serves by bridging between platelets and injury site in the blood vessel wall, and it circulates as a complex with factor VIII, protecting it from rapid degradation. More than 20 different types and subtypes of vWD have been described but almost all patients can be classified as having 1 of the 2 most common types of vWD. About 70 % of patients have type 1 and about 10-20 % present themself with type 2A and 2B vWD type 3 in about 10 %. By taking a clinical history of bleeding it is important to think about vWD and to make the appropriate diagnosis. If the vWD is suspected diagnostic tests should include an activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, factor VIII:C, Ristocetin cofactor, and vWF antigen. Additional testing of ristocetin induced plattlet adhesion (RIPA), the multimeric structure and collagen binding test and gen-analysis allow diagnosing the different types of v. Willebrand Disease. The treatment of choice in mild forms is the synthetic agent desmopressin. In patients with severe type 1, type 2B, 2N and type 3 or in people who do not response to desmopressin, the appropriate treatment is a factor VIII concentrate that is rich of vWF. Until now no recommendations in the orthopaedic literature have been found regarding diagnosis and treatment of vWS patients. Based on the experience with 43 orthopaedic patients presenting vWD over the last 15 years a contemporary guideline for the successful perioperative management of vWD in orthopaedic surgery is presented. In a close collaboration between the orthopaedic surgeon and the specialized haemostaseologist every invasive procedure in patients with vWD can be undertaken without the risk of excessive bleeding.",/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/data/hemophilia/datasets/hemophilia.txt,What are the symptoms of von Willebrand disease?,"The symptoms of von Willebrand disease include mucous membrane bleeding, such as epistaxis, hypermenorrhea, and excessive bleeding from surgery and dental procedures.

"Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is a laboratory test for the diagnosis of blood coagulation disorders.
