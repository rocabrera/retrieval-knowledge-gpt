Both hemophilia A and B result from factor VIII and factor IX protein deficiency or dysfunction, respectively, and is characterized by prolonged and excessive bleeding after minor trauma or sometimes even spontaneously. There is hemophilia C as well, which occurs due to deficiency of clotting factor XI but is rare. Sometimes acquired hemophilia can present related to age or childbirth and usually resolves with appropriate treatment. Hemophilia has often been called “the disease of the kings,” as is often described in the descent of Queen Victoria of England. The earliest description in ancient history dates from the second century AD in the Babylonian Talmud about a woman\xa0who had lost her\xa0first two sons from circumcision. The earliest description in modern history was\xa0documented by the\xa0American physician Dr. John Conrad Otto. Dr. Conrad described an inheritable bleeding disorder in several families where only males born from unaffected mothers were affected. He then called them the “bleeders.” Hemophilia, as a word, was first documented by Johann Lukas Schönlein in his dissertation at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. Dr. Nasse was the first to publish the genetic description of hemophilia in Nasse’s Law: which states that hemophilia is transmitted entirely by unaffected females to their sons.', 'Hemophilia A (HA) is an inherited X-linked bleeding disorder, caused by the deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), with variable clinical phenotypes [...].', 'Hemophilia is characterized by genetic mutations resulting in the deficiency of factors critical to the normal process of coagulation, sometimes resulting in spontaneous bleeding into soft tissue, joints, and internal organs.

Molecular mechanisms of hemophilia B are highly heterogeneous including gene deletions, insertions, complex rearrangements, and a large number of point mutations. Currently, hemophilia B is treated by plasma protein replacement therapy. This therapy is effective but exposes patients to possible side effects and complications such as infection of blood-borne pathogens including hepatitis viruses and HIV-1. Intensive efforts to develop alternative, safer therapies for hemophilia B, including somatic gene therapy, are now under way.', ""The most common inherited bleeding disorder in man, haemophilia A, is caused by defect in factor VIII, a component in the blood coagulation pathway. The X-chromosome-linked disease almost certainly stems from a heterogeneous collection of genetic lesions. Because, without proper treatment, haemophilia can be a fatal disease, new mutations are necessary to account for its constant frequency in the population. In addition, haemophilia A displays a wide range of severity, and some 15% of haemophiliacs generate high levels of antibodies against factor VIII ('inhibitor patients'). The present work elucidates the molecular genetic basis of haemophilia in some individuals. Using the recently cloned factor VIII gene as a probe, we have identified two different nonsense point mutations in the factor VIII gene of haemophiliacs, as well as two different partial deletions of the gene. Our survey of 92 haemophiliacs indicates no firm correlation between antibody (inhibitor) production and gross gene defects."", 'The X-linked bleeding disorder hemophilia is caused by mutations in coagulation factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B). Unless prophylactic treatment is provided, patients with severe disease (less than 1% clotting activity) typically experience frequent spontaneous bleeds. Current treatment is largely based on intravenous infusion of recombinant or plasma-derived coagulation factor concentrate. More effective factor products are being developed. Moreover, gene therapies for sustained correction of hemophilia are showing much promise in preclinical studies and in clinical trials. These advances in molecular medicine heavily depend on availability of well-characterized small and large animal models of hemophilia, primarily hemophilia mice and dogs. Experiments in these animals represent important early and intermediate steps of translational research aimed at development of better and safer treatments for hemophilia, such a protein and gene therapies or immune tolerance protocols.

"['Hemophilia is derived from hemo (blood) and philia (love), is recognized as the most common and severe hemorrhagic disorder. Depending upon the pathophysiology, there are three types of hemophilia -A, B, and C, caused by the deficiency or dysfunction of factors VIII, IX, and XI, respectively.\xa0It can be hereditary, which is more common, and a rare variety is the acquired one. Acquired hemophilia is due to the autoantibodies that develop against a coagulation factor. Mostly the antibodies develop against the factor VIII, hence commonly known as ""acquired hemophilia A"" (AHA). Patients with autoantibodies may present with catastrophic bleeding; they usually do not have any past medical history of bleeding episodes or disorder.\xa0Its diagnosis is often difficult because of its rarity and the complexity of the laboratory workup. This article\xa0describes the clinical and biological features, in addition to the therapeutic strategies for this disease. Clinically, the presentation varies from life-threatening bleeds on one end to mild or no bleeds on the other end. The presentation with life-threatening bleeding is usually seen during the initial several weeks, although it can happen at any point during disease if the appropriate treatment is not initiated.', 'Hemophilia is a family of rare bleeding disorders. The two primary types, hemophilia A and hemophilia B, are caused by recessive X-chromosome linked mutations that result in deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), respectively. Clinically, hemophilia is manifested by spontaneous bleeding, particularly into the joints (haemarthrosis) and soft tissue, and excessive bleeding following trauma or surgery. The total overall number of hemophilia patients worldwide is approximately 400,000, however only about 100,000 of these individuals are treated. The first treatment of hemophilia was initiated when it was determined that the clotting deficiency could be corrected by a plasma fraction taken from normal blood. The discovery of factor VIII enrichment by cryoprecipitation of plasma opened a new era of therapy which eventually led to the production of factor concentrates and the subsequent development of highly purified forms of plasma factors. The most significant improvements have been the availability of recombinant forms of factors VIII and IX. Unfortunately, recombinant factors still retain some of the limitations of plasma concentrates. These limitations include development of antibody responses in patients and the relatively short half-life of the molecules requiring frequent injection to maintain effective concentration. Treatment beyond replacement of native factors has been tried. They include the development of modified factor VIII and IX molecules with improved potency, stability and circulating half-life and enhancement of a prothrombotic responses and/or stabilization of coagulation factors via inhibition of key negative regulatory pathways. These approaches will be reviewed in this commentary.', 'Hemophilia is characterized by genetic mutations resulting in the deficiency of factors critical to the normal process of coagulation, sometimes resulting in spontaneous bleeding into soft tissue, joints, and internal organs.

In turn, patient management, including choice and application of therapies, is influenced by the diagnosis, as well as by identification of respective disease severity. An incorrect diagnosis may lead to inappropriate management and unnecessary therapy, and thus to adverse outcomes. Moreover, identification of factor inhibitors in hemophilia will lead to additional and differential treatments, and incorrect identification of inhibitors or inhibitor levels may also lead to inappropriate management. Problems in hemophilia diagnosis or inhibitor detection can occur at any stage in the clinical diagnosis/laboratory interface, from the ""pre-preanalytical"" to ""preanalytical"" to ""analytical"" to ""postanalytical"" to ""post-postanalytical."" This report outlines the various problems in laboratory testing for hemophilia and provides various strategies or solutions to overcome these challenges. Although some outlined solutions are specific to the potential errors related to hemophilia, others are general in nature and can be applied to other areas of laboratory hemostasis. Key to improvement in this area is adoption of best practice by all involved, including clinicians, phlebotomists, and laboratories. Also key is the recognition that such errors may occur, and thus that clinicians should assess laboratory test results in the context of their patient\'s clinical history and follow-up any potential errors, thus avoid misdiagnoses, by requesting repeat testing on a fresh sample.', 'Hemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a reduced level of factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) in blood. Bleeding episodes may occur spontaneously in the severe form of hemophilia or after trauma in the milder forms. It is important that patients are diagnosed correctly, which includes placing them into the correct severity category of the disorder so that appropriate treatment can be given. Diagnosis is made by determination of the amount of FVIII:C in the blood, usually using a one-stage factor VIII:C assay. However, approximately one third of patients with mild or moderate hemophilia will have much lower results by the chromogenic assay, with some of them having normal results by the one-stage assay. The chromogenic factor VIII assay is used in some specialized hemophilia reference centers and is recommended for the diagnosis of mild hemophilia A, as this assay is considered to better reflect the severity status of hemophilia patients than the one-stage assay.', 'The clinical manifestations of hemophilia depend upon both age and the severity of the factor VIII or IX deficiency. Hemophilia A and B cannot be differentiated on clinical grounds.

One of the major lessons to be learned from the HIV epidemic in haemophilia is that it is critical to strive to obtain the safest and purest forms of blood products for these patients. The advent of clinically available recombinant factor VIII is expected soon; in the meantime there is a move towards treating all patients with high purity products."", ""In the past, patients with severe hemophilia have suffered a substantially reduced quality of life with frequent bleeding episodes, disabling arthropathy, and shorter life expectancy.

"['Hemophilia is the most common of the severe bleeding disorders and if not properly managed since early infancy can lead to chronic disease and lifelong disabilities. However, it enjoys the most efficacious and safe treatment among the most prevalent monogenic disorders. Hemophilia should be considered in the neonatal period in the case of unusual bleeding or in the case of positive family history. Later, hemophilia should be suspected mainly in males because of abnormal bruising/bleeding or unusual bleeding following invasive procedures-for example, tonsillectomy or circumcision.

Central venous access catheters and arterovenous fistulas play an important role in the management of hemophilia children requiring repeated and/or urgent administration of coagulation factor concentrates. During childhood and adolescence, personalized treatment strategies that suit the patient and his lifestyle are essential to ensure optimal outcomes. Physical activity is important and can contribute to better coordination, endurance, flexibility and strength. The present article focuses also on questions frequently posed to pediatric hematologists like vaccinations, day-care/school access and dental care.', 'Hemophilia has evolved from an often fatal hereditary bleeding disorder to a disorder for which safe and effective treatment is available. However, there are several challenges remaining in the treatment of hemophilia. Prophylaxis to prevent bleeding is costly and requires frequent intravenous injections, which are cumbersome for patients. Venous access is often difficult to achieve, especially in small children where central venous lines may need to be implanted. Development of inhibitory antibodies makes treatment of acute bleeds difficult and prophylaxis in patients with inhibitors must also be better addressed. In order to improve treatment, new products are being developed, some of which are already in clinical trials. There are several approaches to prolonging half-lives such as PEGylation, Fc fusion and albumin fusion. Increased activity has been demonstrated in preclinical trials for factor IX and in a human trial with factor VII where the activity of the molecules has been increased by manipulation of the molecular composition. Additional approaches, including blockage of inhibitors of clotting, are also under investigation. Factor VIII and factor IX gene therapy have become a tangible possibility since phase I data recently have been published. Results are promising and there is hope that in the near future substantial progress will be made, perhaps making hemophilia the first genetic condition to be cured.', 'Individuals with severe factor VIII deficiency experience recurrent hemorrhages and develop progressive joint damage. Large retrospective, nonrandomized studies of patient cohorts followed over decades show that factor prophylaxis initiated at an early age before the onset of recurrent bleeding reduces the incidence of hemophilic arthropathy. Two recent prospective, multicenter, randomized trials conducted in Europe (the ESPRIT study) and the USA (the Joint Outcome Study) confirm the efficacy of prophylaxis in the prevention of hemarthroses and arthropathy. Regular prophylaxis initiated in early childhood enhances the quality of life for patients with severe hemophilia and reduces the risk of inhibitor development. The substantial costs of such preventative therapy may be offset by the reduced expenditures that the care of degenerative joint disease in adult hemophilia patients would otherwise require.', 'Hemophilia is characterized by joint hemorrhage with subsequent development of arthropathy. During the past 40 to 50 years, factor VIII concentrates have been developed that enable effective treatment of bleeding. However, the development of dosing, including the implementation of prophylaxis, has been hampered by concentrate transmission of blood-borne diseases. Since the advent of viral reducing procedures that were applied to plasma-derived products and the implementation of recombinant DNA technology into the manufacturing procedure, concentrates can be considered as safe today, and hemophilic care can be more focused on the treatment modalities as such. Thus, prophylaxis is being improved and made available to more patients. Studies are in progress in order to give more scientific evidence behind its use. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) seems promising in scaling early arthropathy and may be a tool in the future, superior to plain X-ray and orthopedic examination, to follow patients on prophylaxis, especially children. The development of inhibitors is the most severe threat to the health of hemophiliacs today and in the future. Much has been done to elucidate genetic factors predisposing for inhibitors, and the reactivity of inhibitors with the factor VIII molecule has also been investigated. More has to be done, however, and there are still many open issues regarding immune tolerance treatment and treatment of acute bleeding in inhibitor patients. Hemophilic care has come far in order to restore health for the hemophilic population. The treatment is effective in the prevention of joint disease and the inhibitor problem is handled better now. Side effects have been reduced to a minimum. In addition, carrier and prenatal diagnosis add important contributions to improve life for the patient and his family.

Given that further studies are needed to explore issues such as optimal treatment and dosage, particularly in patients with inhibitors to factor VIII or factor IX, this paper also considers potential pitfalls in the design and conduct of clinical trials in hemophilia and suggests how careful forward planning may help to avoid them.']","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/24014073.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/28534860.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/32809329.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/16427391.txt']",How is hemophilia different from other bleeding disorders?,"Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder caused by deficiency or dysfunction of factors VIII, IX, or XI, and is recognized as the most common and severe hemorrhagic disorder. It can be hereditary or acquired, and is traditionally considered clinically indistinguishable from hemophilia B, but differences in bleeding frequency, clinical scores, use of prophylaxis, and need for orthopedic surgery have been reported. Hemophilia has the most efficacious and safe treatment among the most prevalent monogenic disorders, and personalized treatment strategies are essential to ensure optimal outcomes.","Hemophilia is a genetic bleeding disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot. It is different from other bleeding disorders because it specifically affects the clotting factors in the blood, whereas other bleeding disorders may be caused by platelet deficiencies or blood vessel abnormalities.",gpt3.5_turbo,abstracts,chroma
"['Hemophilia A, which is the most common form of hemophilia, is caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII. The incidence of hemophilia A is 1:10,000 people worldwide. The most common complication associated with hemophilia A is bleeding into joints, predominantly the knees, ankles, and elbows, which may lead to destruction or osteoarthritis of the specific joint. Various degrees of disability may follow these initial or recurrent hemorrhages. Subsequent to improvements in medical management, patients with hemophilia A currently have a life expectancy similar to that of the normal population. However, the management of patients with hemophilia A remains a clinical challenge for various reasons, including the lack of reliable and cost-effective treatment, and the high risk of intra- or post-operative hemorrhages. Large hemorrhages due to the phlebotomizing of young patients are very rare. To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the first report regarding the occurrence of a large hemorrhage due to venipuncture in the elbow of a patient with hemophilia A, and discusses the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and the medico-chirurgical treatment of this patient.', 'Because of an increased life expectancy, (age-related) co-morbidity is becoming a common occurrence in haemophilia patients. In this review, haemophilia-related and non-haemophilia-related medical problems, treatment recommendations and psychosocial consequences in ageing haemophilia patients are discussed. Haemophilic arthropathy is an important cause of pain and disability, and a frequent indication for surgery in haemophilia patients. In addition, many adult patients are infected with hepatitis C or HIV, the consequences and treatment of which can add to physical and mental discomfort. Moreover, inhibitors against factor VIII can also develop in adulthood, especially in patients with mild haemophilia. Hypertension is reported to occur more often in haemophilia patients than in the general population. Other internal problems, like renal abnormalities, overweight, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia are discussed. Haemophilia seems to protect against cardiovascular disease, although the incidence is increasing. Recommendations are given on dealing with tooth extractions, surgical interventions and sexuality problems in patients with haemophilia. In addition to haemophilia in itself, co-morbidity has a major psychological impact, and an important effect on quality of life. It can also result in complex treatment regimens, in which coordination between health care workers is essential.', 'Severe hemophilia A is defined by factor VIII level of <1%. Limited research and case series show that these patients are at the highest risk for bleeding complications, the most common being hemarthrosis and muscle hematoma, respectively.1 While rare, iliopsoas hematoma carries significant morbidity, mortality, and requires prompt intervention in hemophiliac patients. As such, it is essential the emergency providers evaluate for this condition in this unique patient population.

"[""The psychosocial impact of hemophilia on activities was recently investigated in the Hemophilia Experiences, Results and Opportunities (HERO) study (675 people with hemophilia and 561 caregivers of children with hemophilia in 10 countries). The impact of hemophilia B may not be accurately reflected in the HERO results, as ~75% of respondents described issues affecting males with hemophilia A. To address the needs of this population, the Bridging Hemophilia B Experiences, Results and Opportunities Into Solutions (B-HERO-S) was developed as a pilot study in the United States in collaboration with the hemophilia community. The analysis reported here assessed engagement in recreational activities and changes to treatment regimens around activities as reported by 299 adults with hemophilia B and 150 caregivers of children with hemophilia B. Nearly all adults with hemophilia B (98%) experienced a negative impact on their participation in recreational activities due to hemophilia-related issues, and most caregivers (90%) reported that hemophilia B had a negative impact on their child's engagement in recreational activities. One of the main reasons identified for discontinuing past activities was the risk of bruising or bleeding (adults/children with hemophilia B, 49%/41%). In particular, adults with hemophilia B reported a history of activity-related bleeding, and most adults decreased their participation in high-risk activities as they aged. Substantial percentages of adults and children with hemophilia B (including mild/moderate severity) altered their treatment regimens to accommodate planned activities. These findings may help inform guidelines for individualizing treatment regimens around participation in recreational activities based on hemophilia severity, baseline factor level, and activity risk and intensity."", ""In the past, patients with severe hemophilia have suffered a substantially reduced quality of life with frequent bleeding episodes, disabling arthropathy, and shorter life expectancy. In addition, methods of treatment and management have been costly and time-consuming, and have placed a considerable burden on patients' physical and psychological well-being. With the advent of the on-demand therapy and prophylactic treatment paradigm, patients have been able to receive care with less interruption of daily activities. Treatments may be more challenging for hemophiliacs with inhibitors to replacement factor; however, recent advances in the use of bypassing agents and immune tolerance therapy have enabled them to aggressively manage their disease while maintaining their independence. This review focuses on the challenges of treating such a severe hemophiliac through examination of the lifetime experience of a young adult male with a severe form of congenital hemophilia A. At this stage of his life, the patient has minimal disabilities and is inhibitor-free through optimal care and strong family support. His aspiration to pursue a productive life has led him to a career in medicine. After receiving his medical degree, he pursued a specialty in the treatment of hemophilia.

HERO did not specifically evaluate impact on education in adults/children with mild/moderate hemophilia or the impact on employment of spouses/partners of caregivers of affected children. The Bridging Hemophilia B Experiences, Results and Opportunities into Solutions (B-HERO-S) study evaluated the impact of hemophilia on the lives of adult men/women with mild-severe hemophilia B and caregivers of boys/girls with hemophilia B and their spouses/partners. Many adults with hemophilia B (94%) reported that hemophilia had a negative effect on their ability to complete a formal education, often attributed to the inability to attend or concentrate in school as a result of hemophilia-related bleeding or pain. Most adults with hemophilia B (95%) and caregivers/partners (89%/84%) indicated that hemophilia had a negative impact on employment. Most adults with hemophilia were employed (81%), with construction/manufacturing (35%) as the most frequently reported industry; many worked in jobs requiring manual labor (39%). Of those unemployed, 62% never worked, and those who stopped working reported that they left the workforce due to financial issues (59%), including insurance coverage/co-pays, or hemophilia-related issues (55%). Nearly one-third of caregivers voluntarily left the workforce to care for children with hemophilia. These results suggest a need to focus more effort on career counseling for adults with hemophilia B and caregivers of affected children, especially around mild/moderate hemophilia, as this population may not be as well informed regarding potential impact in school and the workplace.', 'The impact of haemophilia and its treatment on social status has not been well studied, although research into the quality of life of patients with haemophilia has shed some light on aspects of social and role functioning. Studies conducted before the advent of safe and effective coagulation factor replacement therapy suggest that the haemophilia population was predominantly of low socioeconomic status with many social disadvantages, including high rates of disability and unemployment and low rates of marriage. Since the availability of purified factor VIII concentrates that could be used in a home-care setting and as prophylaxis, most research suggests that social status and well-being amongst children, adolescents, and adults with haemophilia is not compromised, and is comparable to that of the general population. Children and adolescents with haemophilia do not generally feel disadvantaged, although haemophilia-related issues at school and amongst peer groups do arise. Recent studies in adults show higher than average rates of marriage and cohabitation and the attainment of a generally good educational status, but, as in the past, employment rates remain comparatively lower.

"['Patients with haemophilia are now widely advised to participate in sports. However, no extensive data are available about their actual participation. A self-administered questionnaire was used to investigate sports participation by persons with haemophilia in the Netherlands. All 293 questionnaires that were distributed have been returned; 217 were from people with severe haemophilia A or B (this is 40% of the severely affected Dutch population with haemophilia). Of this group, 155 (71%) participate in one or more sports: 66 swim, 36 cycle, 21 play tennis, 18 do fitness exercises, 16 ice skate, 10 ski and 10 play table tennis; in total 44 different sports are mentioned. Of a group of 16 persons with haemophilia who are unable to run, 10 (63%) participate in sport and of a group of 91 who can only run sometimes, 64 (70%) engage in sports. This shows that there are ample opportunities for persons with haemophilia to participate in sports, even if they are unable to run. Severely affected persons with haemophilia are as active as the general Dutch population; in fact, a higher proportion swims and/or cycles. In conclusion, sports participation in the Netherlands by persons with haemophilia is in accordance with World Federation of Hemophilia directives.', ""Historically, people with hemophilia have been warned to avoid physical activities as a possible cause of bleeding; however, currently, sport is considered necessary, especially in the developmental age, for providing a good quality of life. A survey was proposed to a group of hematologists and sports physicians working in Puglia, Italy, to explore their approach to physical activities for their patients with hemophilia and to obtain suggestions about possible interventions to promote the access of patients to sports. The survey was answered by 6 hematologists and 15 sports physicians. In total, 71% (about six patients/year/physician) of patients with hemophilia seen by sports physicians asked for counseling about sports, and 67% (about five patients/year/physician) actually practiced sports. On the other hand, only 31% (about 16 patients/year/hematologist) of patients asked hematologists questions on sports, and only 16% (about seven patients/year/hematologist) of patients with hemophilia and that were followed-up by hematologists practiced sports. The sports most often recommended to patients with hemophilia by physicians included swimming, athletics, tennis, running and gymnastics. According to hematologists, physical activity was very efficient in improving the quality of life of patients; stability of joints; their psychological, social and musculoskeletal wellbeing; and in reducing the risk of bleedings. On the other hand, physical activity was considered less important in all these areas by sport physicians. In conclusion, answers to this survey suggested that sports could be promoted among hemophilic patients by increasing the sports physicians' knowledge about hemophilia and their special role in this area. In addition, interviewed clinicians were of the opinion that increased awareness of specific guidelines and clinical practice protocols among both hematologists and sports physicians could be beneficial.

Bypassing agents like rFVIIa can be used in children with success.', 'Hemophilia is the most common of the severe bleeding disorders and if not properly managed since early infancy can lead to chronic disease and lifelong disabilities. However, it enjoys the most efficacious and safe treatment among the most prevalent monogenic disorders. Hemophilia should be considered in the neonatal period in the case of unusual bleeding or in the case of positive family history. Later, hemophilia should be suspected mainly in males because of abnormal bruising/bleeding or unusual bleeding following invasive procedures-for example, tonsillectomy or circumcision. Prophylactic treatment that is started early with clotting-factor concentrates has been shown to prevent hemophilic arthropathy and is, therefore, the gold standard of care for hemophilia A and B in most countries with adequate resources. Central venous access catheters and arterovenous fistulas play an important role in the management of hemophilia children requiring repeated and/or urgent administration of coagulation factor concentrates. During childhood and adolescence, personalized treatment strategies that suit the patient and his lifestyle are essential to ensure optimal outcomes.

Advances in hemophilia are due largely to the development of specialized hemophilia treatment centers, which created a system of comprehensive care and focused healthcare efforts on prevention and education. Parallel advances in coagulation resulted in identification of clotting factors VIII and IX, elucidation of the protein molecular and biochemical structures and functions, sequencing of their respective genes and transfer of the human genes for production of proteins by recombinant technology, and development of gene therapy. The tragedy of the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C raised awareness in patients as well as healthcare providers of the vulnerability of blood products to viral contamination and spurred progress in science leading to viral inactivation of purified proteins. Concomitantly, physicians treating bleeding episodes in the clinic investigated pharmacokinetics and pharmacoeconomics of various strategies of clotting factor replacement. The observation that trough factor levels as low as 1 to 2% were adequate to prevent most bleeding episodes led to current prophylactic regimens that allow boys to participate fully in school and community activities while factor concentrate is infused at home on a regular schedule. Currently, children with hemophilia look forward to a normal life expectancy and excellent health-related quality of life. Physician and community partnerships through research and advocacy societies have accelerated clinical advancements as well as extension of treatment to developing countries.

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of clinical series. SETTING: Referral-based university medical center. PATIENTS: Seven hundred one patients with classic hemophilia (hemophilia A; factor VIII ""deficiency"") were studied for the years from 1900 to 1990; patients were identified in 289 families. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Relative risk for mortality and median life expectancy among hemophiliacs were compared with those among normal U.S. males. Overall, mortality (relative to that of contemporaneous U.S. males) was increased about sixfold among severely affected patients, more than twofold among moderately affected patients, and was equivalent to that of U.S. males among mildly affected patients. Median life expectancy at 1 year of age had reached almost 68 years in the decade 1971 to 1980, but declined to only 49 years in the decade 1981 to 1990. CONCLUSIONS: After improvement in survival from 1971-1980 (corresponding to widespread treatment with lyophilized concentrates of antihemophilic factor [factor VIII]), relative mortality is now increasing, especially among severely affected patients, in large measure because of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).', 'Since the 1970s, mortality in the hemophilia population has been dominated by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and few reports have described mortality in uninfected individuals.

Given disease severity and factor inhibitor status, all-cause mortality did not differ significantly between hemophilia A and hemophilia B. In severe hemophilia, all-cause mortality did not change significantly during 1977 to 1999. During this period, it exceeded mortality in the general population by a factor of 2.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.37-3.05), and median life expectancy in severe hemophilia was 63 years. In moderate/mild hemophilia, all-cause mortality did not change significantly during 1985 to 1999, and median life expectancy was 75 years. Compared with mortality in the general population, mortality from bleeding and its consequences, and from liver diseases and Hodgkin disease, was increased, but for ischemic heart disease it was lower, at only 62% (95% CI: 51%-76%) of general population rates, and for 14 other specific causes it did not differ significantly from general population rates.

Forty-three patients died, while 20 deaths were expected in a hypothetical group of non-haemophiliacs of the same age distribution. Hence, overall mortality was 2.1 times higher than in the general population. This leads to a calculated life expectancy of 66 years, as compared to 74 years in the general male population. Mortality did not differ much by severity of haemophilia. A possibly beneficial effect of prophylaxis on longevity was observed. Haemorrhage occurred in half of all deaths and among these traumatic bleeding was the most prevalent.

When women made a conscious decision not to have children, the reasons were fear of passing haemophilia onto their child (44%), previous experience with haemophilia (6%) and the stress of going through prenatal tests (7%). Severity of the disease in the family, haemophilia diagnosis, results of DNA studies, religion and year of birth had no effect on this decision. Our data indicate that haemophilia and related factors in the family have an influence on women's reproductive choices."", 'Aim \u2003Very little is known regarding reproductive choices, pregnancy, and delivery of women with moderate to severe hemophilia. Our aim was to describe our experience with three hemophiliac women and their journey to achieve motherhood. Methods \u2003Medical charts of women with moderate to severe hemophilia A treated at our center were evaluated. Data regarding choices of conception, pregnancy course, mode of delivery, and pregnancy outcomes were obtained. Results \u2003Three women are presented. Whereas patient 1 chose to adopt her first child and later had twins through egg donations and a surrogate mother, patient 2 underwent spontaneous pregnancy and delivered via cesarean section. Patient 3 preferred in vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic diagnosis to avoid hemophilia and hemophilia carriership in her offspring. Conclusion \u2003The appropriate means to achieve parenthood for women with moderate to severe hemophilia should be individualized and requires support of a comprehensive multidisciplinary team.', 'QUESTION: A patient in my clinic, who is 10 weeks into her first pregnancy and is a known carrier of hemophilia B, is considering the advantages and disadvantages of antenatal tests and is especially worried about a vaginal delivery thatmight cause bleeding. How should I manage her pregnancy? ANSWER: Many female carriers of hemophilia were found to have lower-than-expected levels of plasma factors, which are thought to be due to X chromosome inactivation. Chorionic villous sampling is the preferred test to determine the sex of the fetus and whether a male infant is affected with hemophilia. Vaginal delivery is not contraindicated and has been proven during the last two decades to be as safe as cesarean section. Vacuum extraction should be avoided to minimize risk of intracranial hemolysis and severe cephalhematoma.', 'BACKGROUND: Hemophilia carriers (HCs) face specific psychosocial challenges related to pregnancy, caused by their inherited bleeding disorder. Optimal support from healthcare providers can only be realized by exploring medical and psychological healthcare requirements. OBJECTIVE: To review all published evidence on the experiences and attitudes of HCs regarding reproductive decision-making, prenatal diagnosis, pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium to provide an accessible overview of this information for health care providers. STUDY SELECTION: Cochrane library, PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched for original qualitative data. Two authors performed study selection, risk-of-bias assessment, data extraction, and data analysis through meta-summary. The extracted themes were discussed within the research team. FINDINGS: Fifteen studies with an overall moderate quality were included. The following findings were identified: (a) Quality of life of family members with hemophilia influences reproductive decision-making; (b) Genetic counselling is generally considered useful; (c) The development of a specialized carrier clinic is considered valuable; (d) HCs describe prenatal diagnosis as beneficial yet psychosocially challenging; and (e) noninvasive prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are predominantly considered beneficial. These findings are limited by the overall moderate quality of included studies and the possibly partly outdated results in the current era of hemophilia treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Available qualitative literature on HCs around pregnancy focuses on genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. Future studies are needed on the experiences and needs of HCs through pregnancy and puerperium as well as in light of emerging hemophilia diagnosis and treatment options.']","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/10632739.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/34104857.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/14708924.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/32271985.txt']",How does hemophilia affect pregnancy?,"Hemophilia can affect pregnancy in various ways, including the risk of bleeding during delivery and the possibility of passing the condition onto the child.

"['We have examined reproduction patterns in hemophilic men and carrier women seen at a hemophilia treatment center. The study group included 309 patients with hemophilia A or B: 194 adults and 115 children from 246 pedigrees; 93% of affected men and 96% of parents of affected children had received genetic counseling. In the collected pedigrees, 65% of affected males were born to women with family history of hemophilia. An additional 23% of mothers were later shown to be carriers. Fewer than 12% of cases could be due to a new mutation in the child. Among 209 hemophilia A carrier tests, 95% of obligate carriers were detectable, 87% of mothers of sporadic cases, 53% of sisters of hemophiliacs, and 24% of other relatives had a high risk of carriership. Of 49 high-risk women seen during or prior to pregnancy, one-half elected prenatal diagnosis. Amniocentesis was performed in 24 cases and 8 were referred for fetoscopy, resulting in 18 normal offspring. Among 25 pregnancies not tested, 14 continued and produced 3 affected males and 11 normal offspring. Of hemophilic men over age 25, 66% have married and 41% (62% of those married) have had children. These observations will serve as a baseline for assessing any change in reproductive patterns occurring with the introduction of new genetic techniques.', 'Carriers of hemophilia have a 50% chance of giving birth to a hemophilic son. Approximately 35% may have a lower than normal factor VIII or IX and therefore can be diagnosed without genetic testing. These individuals may present with menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia and dysmenorrhoea. The treatment of menorrhagia is similar to girls without bleeding disorders--tranexamic acid, the oral contraceptive pill and, where acceptable, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device. Genetic diagnosis is possible for potential carriers--50% families with severe hemophilia carry the intron 22 inversion and databases are available which list most of the causative mutations for hemophilia A and B. Ideally the mutation in the index in a family is known. The testing of adolescents for a recessively inherited condition raises ethical issues and guidance may vary within different countries and cultures.', 'Haemophilia is an X-linked inherited rare bleeding disorder affecting mainly men. The treatment consists of replacement therapy that has been associated with severe side effects, such as blood transmitted viral infections, but has markedly improved over the last decades. The aim of this study was to study family structure over time among Swedish persons with haemophilia (PWH), focusing on children, siblings and marital status. PWH A or B were identified from the haemophilia centres and the national Patient Registry. Each PWH was compared to five age- and gender-matched controls. The national Multi-Generation Registry was used to identify children and siblings. A total of 1365 children with a father suffering from haemophilia A or B and 1938 siblings of the PWH were identified. Having one or more children was significantly less common (P\xa0=\xa00.003) for PWH than for controls. Significantly lower rates of having a child were also found for the subgroups of persons suffering from severe haemophilia and those infected with HIV (P\xa0<\xa00.001). A higher proportion of PWH, with or without HIV and/or viral hepatitis had siblings compared to the controls (P\xa0<\xa00.001). However, the mean number of siblings was significantly lower for persons with severe haemophilia (P\xa0=\xa00.001). The number of marriages and divorces did not differ between PWH and controls. Our data indicate a negative impact of HIV and viral hepatitis on family structure for PWH despite the relatively good access to treatment in Sweden over the last few decades. This was particularly true for those with a severe form of haemophilia.', ""In an analysis of 804 haemophilia pedigrees, mild to moderate haemophilia A or B was found to be clearly familial in 70% of cases, severe haemophilia B in 57% of cases and severe haemophilia A in 45% of cases. The rest of the patients were 'sporadic' i.e., either isolated cases or brothers in the first affected sibship. In sporadic families, 88% of mothers but only 19% of maternal grandmothers had the relevant mutation in their white blood cells. Among patients with familial haemophilia, half the patients with mild haemophilia and those with severe haemophilia B had a direct male ancestor with haemophilia, but only 28% of patients with severe haemophilia A had such a progenitor.""]","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/3565475.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/21108512.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/24372762.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/17212731.txt']",Can hemophilia be passed down through generations?,"Yes, hemophilia can be passed down through generations as it is an X-linked inherited disorder affecting mainly men.",Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that is passed down through generations.,gpt3.5_turbo,abstracts,chroma
"['Factor VIII (FVIII), an essential blood coagulation protein, is a key component of the fluid phase blood coagulation system. Human factor VIII is a single chain of about 300 kDa consisting of domains described as A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. The protein undergoes processing prior to secretion into blood resulting in a heavy chain of 200 kDa (A1-A2-B) and a light chain of 80 kDa (A3-C1-C2) linked by metal ions. The role of factor VIII is to increase the catalytic efficiency of factor IXa in the activation of factor X. Variants of these factors lead frequently also to severe bleeding disorders.', 'Factor VIII (FVIII), a coagulation factor in the blood, is one of the most complex proteins known today. To facilitate the rapid development of a more convenient and safer FVIII product and to improve the quality of life for hemophilia patients, this short article reviews the recent investigations on the structure, activity, and more importantly, stability of FVIII.', 'Coagulation factor V (FV) is the protein cofactor required in vivo for the rapid generation of thrombin catalyzed by the prothrombinase complex. It also represents a central regulator in the early phases of blood clot formation, as it contributes to the anticoagulant pathway by participating in the downregulation of factor VIII activity. Conversion of precursor FV to either a procoagulant or anticoagulant cofactor depends on the local concentration of procoagulant and anticoagulant enzymes, so that FV may be regarded as a daring tight-rope walker gently balancing opposite forces. Given this dual role, genetic defects in the FV gene may result in opposite phenotypes (hemorrhagic or thrombotic). Besides a concise description on the structural, procoagulant and anticoagulant properties of FV, this review will focus on bleeding disorders associated with altered levels of this molecule. Particular attention will be paid to the mutational spectrum of type I FV deficiency, which is characterized by a remarkable genetic heterogeneity and by an uneven distribution of mutations throughout the FV gene.', 'Factor VIII (FVIII, other clotting factors are named similarly) is a glycoprotein that circulates in the plasma bound to von Willebrand factor. During the blood coagulation cascade, activated FVIII (FVIIIa) binds to FIXa and activates FX in the presence of calcium ions and phospholipid membranes. The C1 and C2 domains mediate membrane binding that is essential for activation of the FVIIIa-FIXa complex. Here, (1)H, (13)C, and (15)N backbone chemical shift assignments are reported for the C2 domain of FVIII, including assignments for the residues in solvent-exposed loops.

"['For decades, the monogenetic bleeding disorders hemophilia A and B (coagulation factor VIII and IX deficiency) have been treated with systemic protein replacement therapy. Now, diverse molecular medicines, ranging from antibody to gene to RNA therapy, are transforming treatment. Traditional replacement therapy requires twice to thrice weekly intravenous infusions of factor. While extended half-life products may reduce the frequency of injections, patients continue to face a lifelong burden of the therapy, suboptimal protection from bleeding and joint damage, and potential development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (inhibitors) that require less efficacious bypassing agents and further reduce quality of life. Novel non-replacement and gene therapies aim to address these remaining issues. A recently approved factor VIII-mimetic antibody accomplishes hemostatic correction in patients both with and without inhibitors. Antibodies against tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) target natural anticoagulant pathways to rebalance hemostasis. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy provides lasting clotting factor replacement and can also be used to induce immune tolerance. Multiple gene-editing techniques are under clinical or preclinical investigation. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of these approaches, explain how they differ from standard therapies, and predict how the hemophilia treatment landscape will be reshaped.', 'During the last 50 years, clotting factor replacement has evolved from the use of frozen plasma in the 1950s, through the serendipitous discovery of cryoprecipitate in the 1960s and the development of purified clotting factors in the 1970s and 1980s, to the era of recombinant clotting factors beginning in the 1990s. The dawn of the new millennium has seen the refinement of recombinant factor (rF) VIII with enhanced safety via the elimination of plasma-derived culture media or product stabilizers. During the last decade of the 20th century, a cure for hemophilia through gene therapy became a possibility. This was, in part, facilitated by availability of large (dogs) and small (mice) animal models for hemophilia A and B. Although this review will focus primarily on clotting factor replacement, the reader may refer to recent discourse on gene therapy for hemophilia.', 'Conventional hemophilia treatment is based on repeated infusion of the missing clotting factor. This therapy is lifelong, expensive and can result in the formation of neutralizing antibodies, thus causing failure of the treatment and requiring higher doses of the replacement drug. Areas covered: Gene and cell therapies offer the advantage of providing a definitive and long-lasting correction of the mutated gene, promoting its physiological expression and preventing neutralizing antibody development. This review focuses on the most recent approaches that have been shown to prevent and even eradicate immune response toward the replaced factor. Expert commentary: Despite the encouraging data demonstrated by ongoing clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, more extensive investigations are necessary to establish the long-term safety and efficacy of gene therapy treatments in maintaining immune tolerance.', 'BACKGROUND: Approximately 4550 persons were under treatment for hemophilia in Germany in 2017. The condition is currently treated with intravenous supplementa- tion of the missing clotting factor, either prophylactically or as needed. Newer treat- ment options rely on novel mechanisms of action. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in MEDLINE/PubMed, as well as on expert opinions and the recommenda- tions of specialty societies. RESULTS: Randomized controlled trials have shown that, in children aged 30 months to 6 years, prophylactic clotting-factor supplementation yields a markedly lower an- nual rate of hemorrhage than supplementation as needed: 3.27 (standard deviation [SD] 6.24) for the former vs. 17.69 (SD 9.25) for the latter. A similar large effect was seen in patients aged 12 to 50 years, with hemorrhage rates of 1.9 (SD 4.1) vs. 28.7 (SD 18.8). Clotting-factor preparations with longer half-lives make it possible to lessen the frequency of administration and to prevent subtherapeutic factor levels. A number of alternatives to clotting-factor supplementation have recently been approved or are currently being clinically tested. These new drugs are injected sub- cutaneously and have a longer half-life, possibly enabling better protection against bleeding than the current standard treatment. A further advantage of some of these drugs is that they can be given even in the presence of inhibitors to factor VIII. In addition, initial (phase I) clinical trials of gene therapy have been performed suc- cessfully for both hemophilia A and hemophilia B. CONCLUSION: Now that new alternatives to classic supplementation therapy are be- coming available, pertinent treatment algorithms for patients with hemophilia will have to be developed. It is still unclear to what extent the new drugs might supplant clotting factor supplementation as the first line of treatment.']","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/31843450.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/16163206.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/30345839.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/31847949.txt']",How is clotting factor replacement therapy administered?,"Clotting factor replacement therapy is administered through intravenous infusions, typically requiring twice to thrice weekly treatments.",Clotting factor replacement therapy can be administered through intravenous infusion.,gpt3.5_turbo,abstracts,chroma
"['The risk of pathogen transmission via clotting factor therapies has been reduced over the last two decades through the development of effective and progressively more sensitive pathogen screening and inactivation methods and the introduction of recombinant clotting factors for hemophilia, beginning with recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) in 1992. However, new understanding about the potential for transmission of an emerging infectious agent through blood and blood products has renewed concerns about vulnerabilities that remain in plasma-derived and some recombinant clotting therapies that still use plasma components during some stages of the manufacturing process. In the 1980s, patients with hemophilia became ""canaries in the coal mine"" for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the blood supply. Moving forward, healthcare providers must continue to take a proactive role in educating themselves about new information regarding emerging pathogens and develop approaches to discussing this risk with their patients as part of their therapy selection process.', ""In the last three decades there have been dramatic improvements in the availability and quality of treatment for people with inherited coagulation disorders. Indeed, the improvement of methods of purification and viral inactivation for plasma-derived coagulation factor concentrates first and then the development of products utilizing recombinant DNA technology have greatly improved the life expectancy of hemophiliacs, which has progressively become similar to that of males in the general population. Nowadays, the most frequent complication of factor replacement therapy for hemophilia is the development of inhibitors. However, no studies so far have systematically analysed the type and incidence of other adverse reactions following the administration of coagulation factor concentrates. The aim of this systematic review was to screen the published literature data to evaluate the types and frequencies of non-thrombotic-, non-inhibitor-associated adverse reactions to coagulation factor concentrates in patients with hemophilia A, hemophilia B and von Willebrand's disease. On behalf the European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance System (EUHASS), a systematic review of the prospective studies published in the last 20 years was performed using electronic databases and article references. Both severe and mild adverse events following infusion of coagulation factor concentrates are relatively rare in patients with inherited coagulation disorders; the most common events are of an allergic type. There are no differences in the rate of adverse events caused by plasma-derived or recombinant products. On the whole, these data confirm the high degree of safety of the products currently used for replacement therapy."", 'Medicinal products of biological origin still carry a specific iatrogenic risk, mainly because of their starting material, mode of preparation and variability. Careful postmarketing surveillance systems are therefore necessary. To assess the long-term safety of haemophilia treatment with plasma-derived and recombinant clotting factor products, a cohort study was set up in France in 1994. Participants were patients with haemophilia A and B, with or without previous clotting factor therapy. Clinical events, treatments, biological data and adverse events were recorded on standard forms. Blood samples were separated into serum, plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, frozen, and banked in a central laboratory. The same data and samples were collected at yearly follow-up visits. As of December 1999, 1234 haemophiliacs were enrolled in 39 haemophilia centres. At enrollment, 50.2% of patients were under 15 years of age, and the cumulative number of days of exposure to the product was below 50 in 35.1% of cases. The median duration of follow-up was 26.9 months, with a total of 2729 patient-years (135,947 days of exposure and 211 million units of factor VIII or IX). To date, only 17 patients were lost to follow-up. The initial results show good compliance with this health-watch policy among patients and clinicians specializing in haemophilia. The regular follow-up data and centralized sample bank will serve to investigate rapidly any suspected outbreaks as soon as reliable biological tests become available in the future.', 'In spite of the numerous complications of transfusion therapy, there is no doubt that development of convenient clotting factor concentrates for home care has revolutionized the care of patients with hemophilia. With the obvious exception of HIV infections and chronic hepatitis, the majority of patients have few clinically significant adverse side effects in spite of years of replacement therapy. The development of improved viral attenuation processes may have eliminated the viral contamination of these products, but this is yet to be confirmed. The recent breakthrough in the development of highly purified, genetically engineered FVIII products will, it is hoped, eliminate all of the complications of therapy with the exception of inhibitor development. The development of recombinant FVIII replacement should ultimately lead to the availability of reasonably priced products in potentially unlimited supply. If this can be achieved, we may be able to look forward to prophylactic infusion therapy for patients with severe FVIII deficiency and eliminate the significant complications that continue to occur even with prompt treatment of hemorrhage and thrombosis.']","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/16631824.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/22250981.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/11136385.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/8456319.txt']",What are the risks associated with clotting factor replacement therapy?,"The risks associated with clotting factor replacement therapy include the potential for transmission of emerging infectious agents through blood and blood products, as well as the development of inhibitors as a frequent complication.

It involves infusing the missing clotting factor into the patient's bloodstream to help their blood clot properly. However, there are some risks associated with this therapy, including the possibility of developing antibodies to the clotting factor, which can make the treatment less effective over time. Additionally, there is a risk of infection from the infusion process, as well as the risk of blood clots forming in the patient's bloodstream.

"['Inhibitor formation is among the most severe complications of hemophilia treatment. With a cumulative incidence of ∼30% in those with severe hemophilia A and ∼3% in those with severe hemophilia B, inhibitors are caused by a T-cell response directed against infused coagulation factor; these inhibitors neutralize factor VIII or IX activity and disrupt normal hemostasis. Inhibitor patients become unresponsive to standard factor treatment and, as an alternative, use bypass treatment (eg, recombinant factor VIIa or factor VIII inhibitor bypass activity). However, response to bypass agents is poorer and the burden of disease is higher, with greater morbidity, hospitalization, cost, and mortality, than in noninhibitor patients. Furthermore, inhibitor formation interferes with prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes and is a contraindication to gene therapy. Thus, more effective therapies for inhibitor patients are greatly needed. In the last several years, there has been an explosion of novel alternative hemostatic agents for hemophilia patients with and without inhibitors. These agents take advantage of technologic manipulation of coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants to promote hemostasis. The approaches include the following: (1) mutants or mimics of coagulation factors, rendering them resistant to natural anticoagulants; or (2) knock-down or disruption of natural anticoagulants, preventing degradation of coagulation factors. The purpose of this article was to review these novel alternative hemostatic agents and their mechanisms of action, as well as the preliminary pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy data available from early-phase clinical trials.', 'The development of neutralizing antibodies in hemophilia is a serious complication of factor replacement therapy. These antibodies, also known as ""inhibitors"", significantly increase morbidity within the hemophilia population and lower the quality of life for these patients. People with severe hemophilia A have an overall 25-40% lifetime risk of inhibitor development, compared to that of 5-15% lifetime risk in those with moderate/mild hemophilia A. The risk is lower in hemophilia B population (about 1-5%) and occurrence of inhibitors is almost only seen in patients with severe hemophilia B. The understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism leading to the development of inhibitors in patients with hemophilia has improved considerably over the last 2 decades. Identification of early biomarkers which predict inhibitor development in previously untreated patients with hemophilia will assist in risk identification and possible early intervention strategies. In this review, we aim to summarize the molecular mechanisms of inhibitor development in hemophilia and to identify potential areas in need of further investigation.', 'Haemophilia is a serious inherited bleeding disorder resulting from a deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (haemophilia A) or coagulation factor IX (haemophilia B). While effective therapies have been developed to replace the missing factor and restore normal coagulation, they can lead to the development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies, termed inhibitors, which significantly worsen morbidity and quality of life. While advancements have been made to improve the management of patients, and particularly for this review, children with inhibitors, there remain significant unmet needs including inhibitor prevention, inhibitor eradication and, when those fail, more effective bleed prevention and a reduction in the treatment burden. This review will discuss current treatment options including the recently licensed bispecific antibody, emicizumab, and provide insights into how I treat children with inhibitors.', 'Inhibitor antibodies to factor VIII arise in a substantial minority of patients with hemophilia A treated with replacement therapy; factor IX inhibitors in treated hemophilia B patients are considerably less common. As replacement therapy is not feasible in most such patients, hemostasis can generally only be achieved with ""inhibitor bypassing agents"", namely (activated) prothrombin complex concentrates and recombinant factor VIIa. These agents are widely used to treat active bleeding in inhibitor patients but they have been used relatively infrequently as prophylactic agents to prevent bleeding and its consequences, mainly progressive joint damage. This is in contrast to hemophilia patients without inhibitors, in whom prophylactic replacement with concentrates of factor VIII or IX has become widely accepted as the optimal strategy to prevent these adverse outcomes.

"['A patient with idiopathic inhibitor to factor VIII is reported. Treatment with cyclophosphamide and factor VIII (given simultaneously) produced a good clinical response with disappearance of the inhibitor.', 'The standard therapy for patients with haemophilia is prophylactic treatment with replacement factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX). Patients who develop inhibitors against FVIII/FIX face an increased risk of bleeding, and the likelihood of early development of progressive arthropathy, alongside higher treatment-related costs. Bypassing agents can be used to prevent and control bleeding, as well as the recently licensed prophylaxis, emicizumab, but their efficacy is less predictable than that of factor replacement therapy. Antibody eradication, by way of immune tolerance induction (ITI), is still the preferred management strategy for treating patients with inhibitors. This approach is successful in most patients, but some are difficult to tolerise and/or are unresponsive to ITI, and they represent the most complicated patients to treat. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines available to help guide physicians in formulating the next treatment steps in these patients. This review summarises currently available treatment options for patients with inhibitors, focussing on ITI regimens and those ITI strategies that may be used in difficult-to-treat patients. Some alternative, non-ITI approaches for inhibitor management, are also proposed.', 'The treatment of Factor VIII inhibitors remains controversial and no standard therapy exists. We describe in this report two consecutive patients with this inhibitor that responded to cyclosporin. Clinical improvement of the bleeding diathesis, a return to normal of the PTT, a decrease in the level of the inhibitor, and a return to normal of the factor VIII level followed use of this drug. We believe that cyclosporin is effective in the treatment of factor VIII inhibitors and deserves further investigation.', 'Development of inhibitors (alloantibodies to exogenous factor VIII) is the most significant treatment complication in patients with haemophilia A. The only proven way to eradicate inhibitors is through immune tolerance induction (ITI), while bypassing agents are typically employed to treat or prevent bleeds in patients with high titre inhibitors. Costs of these approaches have not been well studied. The aim of this study was to compare lifetime costs of treating patients with severe haemophilia A with inhibitors using on-demand or prophylaxis treatment with bypassing agents and ITI. A decision-analytic model was developed to compare the treatment costs and outcomes. Quantitation of the reduction in bleeding events for patients on prophylaxis and after eradication of inhibitors when on ITI and relapse of inhibitors was derived from published studies. Costs were obtained from standard US costing sources and are reported in 2014 US dollars. Costs and outcomes were discounted 3% per annum. Lifetime costs of treating patients with inhibitors are lower for ITI vs. on-demand or prophylaxis. Patients are also projected to live longer, have greater quality-adjusted life-years, and have fewer bleeding events than patients treated on-demand.

"['The greatest barrier to successful haemophilia A care in resource-rich countries is the development of inhibitors to therapeutic factor VIII. Children with inhibitors suffer through increased bleeding and joint damage as well as frequent venepuncture. Costs associated with inhibitors are beyond many healthcare systems. Over the last two decades, there has been no improvement in our ability to reduce inhibitor development. Current strategies based on early prophylaxis and avoidance of immunological danger signals have given rise to conflicting results. Registry data suggest an increasing problem. Our understanding of the immunological systems involved in inhibitor formation should inform efforts to prevent inhibitors. Great efforts with mouse models are being undertaken in this field. However, there is no guarantee of the availability of any new agents arising from experimental work in the near future. Global immunomodulatory agents may be one solution. Compounds with a long history of use in inflammatory conditions have demonstrated efficacy in preventing antibodies to protein therapeutics both in animal models and in humans. As these compounds have a long history of use in humans, including babies, it may be that these agents offer an option for reducing inhibitor formation in previously untreated patients.', 'Inhibitors are more common than previously thought in any population of patients with haemophilia, particularly those with severe haemophilia. Comparison of a recent analysis of retrospective data on inhibitor incidence with data derived from recombinant factor VIII studies suggests that the incidence of inhibitors is not substantially different between the two groups. However, a distinction must be made between high- and low-responding inhibitors and it is not clear whether low-level inhibitors in some patients are part of the natural history of haemophilia. Questions remain on why some groups might differ in inhibitor levels. Further work is required to ensure standardization of future protocols and continued observation of present cohorts.', 'The development of an inhibitor in a hemophiliac is a serious clinical problem. Many inhibitors have high titers, and thus one cannot guarantee hemostasis. The prevalence of this transfusion-transmitted disease reaches as high as 35%, even with newer products. The costs of product use for inhibitor patients are significantly higher than for those without an inhibitor. For more than 20 years, using the concept of antigen overload, several regimens have existed for the induction of immune tolerance to eradicate these inhibitors. Registries exist reviewing the results of these regimens in the United States and internationally. Although much has been garnered about predictors of outcomes, we have much to learn about who the ideal candidates are, what optimal regimens are, and when to stop, as well as how to maintain a success. The costs of managing an inhibitor patient with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have caused managed care programs to seriously challenge the use of these regimens. Data are needed to provide the cost benefit of immune tolerance.', 'Over the past few decades, important knowledge on why inhibitors develop and better information about significant risk factors have become available. A series of both genetic and nongenetic factors are recognized and clinical score systems were proposed to quantify the risk for each patient. In addition, modulation of the immunological response was acknowledged to play a pivotal role in the occurrence of inhibitors. However, with the exception of mutation testing in severe hemophilia B patients, no single risk factor or clinical score is currently utilized in clinical practice. ""Omics"" technologies are large-scale hypothesis-generating approaches, which provide the tools to study issues contributing to a complex and multifactorial phenomenon, such as inhibitor development. Newer cutting edge technologies may enable a more accurate estimation of the personal risk profile and provide a reliable tool to accurately measure the risk periodically, thereby enabling strategies to foresee and prevent inhibitor formation.']","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/25560794.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/9351534.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/10919412.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/29940657.txt']",Can inhibitors be prevented?,"Efforts are being made to prevent inhibitors in patients with haemophilia A, but current strategies have given conflicting results and registry data suggest an increasing problem.

"['This guideline has been prepared by the authors for and on behalf of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council (MASAC) of the South African Haemophilia Foundation to facilitate the appropriate management of individuals with haemophilia in South Africa. Individuals with haemophilia and their physicians should be advised by a Comprehensive Haemophilia Treatment Centre. Strategies that help to prevent bleeds include regular exercise to strengthen muscles, protect joints and improve fitness; maintaining a healthy body weight to avoid extra stress on joints; and avoiding contact sports. Acute bleeds should be treated early, ideally within 2 hours of onset. Patients with mild or moderate haemophilia A may be treated with desmopressin. Bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A without inhibitors should be treated with factor VIII concentrate. Bleeding in patients with haemophilia B without inhibitors should be treated with factor IX replacement. Tranexamic acid can be used for mucous membrane bleeding in surgical or dental procedures. Bleeds in patients with inhibitors must be managed in consultation with a haemophilia treatment centre. Major bleeding episodes are large muscle or joint bleeds, bleeds resulting from severe injury, or bleeds that affect the central nervous system; gastrointestinal system; neck or throat; hip or iliopsoas; or the forearm compartment. These bleeds may cause death or musculoskeletal deformities, and advice on their treatment should be sought from a haemophilia treatment centre physician. Appropriate factor replacement therapy must be started urgently for major bleeds, and hospitalisation is usually required to maintain adequate factor levels.', 'Haemophilia is the commonest bleeding disorder in the UK, affecting approximately 5400 people, almost all of them male. In haemophiliacs, reduced levels, or absence, of factor VIII (FVIII) cause bleeding episodes, typically into joint spaces or muscles. Haemophilia is generally treated with exogenous FVIII. However, in some haemophiliacs, therapeutically administered FVIII comes to be recognized as a foreign protein, stimulating the production of antibodies (inhibitors), which react with FVIII to render it ineffective. Alternative treatment strategies then have to be used to manage bleeding episodes. In addition, strategies have been developed to attempt to abolish inhibitor production through the induction of immune tolerance. A systematic review was undertaken of current international practice for the clinical management of haemophilia A patients with inhibitors to FVIII, concentrating on literature published from 1995 onwards. Although it can be difficult to determine what constitutes current practice, current guidelines indicate that immune tolerance induction is seen as desirable, with the choice of regimen dependent on patient characteristics, familiarity with regimens and cost. Various approaches, based on similar factors, are used to control bleeding episodes.', 'Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B are the most common of the severe bleeding disorders and are caused by a deficiency in blood clotting factor VIII or factor IX respectively. Factor replacement therapy has been the cornerstone of treatment to treat life threatening bleeds and prevent joint disease. The treatment of hemophilia has evolved tremendously over the past five decades from fresh frozen plasma as the only available therapy to more specific plasma-derived and recombinant-derived factor replacement. Now due to innovations in bioengineering, there are even more efficacious factor replacement options available to patients. Here we review these recent advancements and their impact on the treatment and management of hemophilia.', 'Hematologic primary prohylaxis is the gold standard of treatment in persons with hemophilia (PWH).

These early reactions can change to a chronic synovitis and cause cartilage damage, finally resulting in a complete destruction of the joint. Since 1981 158 adults and 61 children with a hemophilia A or B were treated at the Center for hemophilic disorders Frankfurt in an interdisciplinary approach. Consequent prophylactic treatment with factor substitution can prevent the incidence of severe hemarthrosis. Minor joint bleedings are treated by adequate factor substitution, temporarily non-weight bearing of the extremity, application of ice-packs and physical therapy. More severe joint hemorrhages should be aspirated in order to reduce the acute synovitis. This is followed by a consequent physical therapy (joint and soft tissue techniques) and anti-inflammatory drugs. The goal is a sufficient muscular balance of the joint, the improvement of the coordination, and the proprioception. The chronic synovitis is less painful and poorly responses to conservative interventions. Local ice application, sytemic and local anti-inflammatory treatment support the physical therapy. Soft heel shock absorber, elastic and semi-rigid bandages prevent recurrent bleeding episodes by shock absorption and decrease of synovial impingement. Synovectomy is indicated in cases of chronic persistent synovitis. Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO), which is an alternative in certain cases, has been performed with great success in 12 cases in our hospital.

Despite clear evidence of its effectiveness and the fact that it is recommended by international authorities, prophylaxis still is not widely accepted in the hemophilia community. In the United States, approximately half of children with severe hemophilia A and one third of those with hemophilia B are on prophylactic regimens. Factors limiting acceptance include the need for venous access, factor availability, poor acceptance of injection therapy, safety concerns, cost, and a perceived lack of need. Questions remaining to be answered include the reasons for inter-individual variability in bleeding patterns, predictors for and reversibility of joint damage, and the optimal regimen for prophylaxis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of primary prophylaxis in patients with severe haemophilia A. This study included 15 patients with haemophilia A who received primary prophylaxis at our institution for a minimum of 5\xa0years. We evaluated the annualized bleeding ratio of joints or other sites, current joint function, and X-ray images and MRI scans taken when patients were 6\xa0years old. The range of patients' ages at the end of the study was 6.2-16.8\xa0years, and at the start of primary prophylaxis it was 0.8-2.4\xa0years.

"['This paper reviews the current status on recommendations or guidelines for primary prophylaxis based on recent published papers from organizations or group of experts as well as some original key papers. A rather uniform view exists that prophylaxis should be initiated at an early age before or after no more than a single joint bleed and, if possible, preferably be continued for life. The dose and dose frequency of prophylaxis is dependent on the goal of treatment, bleeding phenotype, compliance, venous access and economic resources in the health care system and should be tailored individually based on clinical outcome and pharmacokinetics. For children, the effectiveness of prophylaxis is more dependent on maintaining minimum trough levels than in adults. Novel extended half-life products are being introduced, which should not affect the decision on when to start prophylaxis nor the initial dose, but which may be helpful for patients with difficult venous access and which may enable higher trough levels of factor VIII.', 'Prophylaxis has become the standard mantra of care for those individuals with severe haemophilia A and B. Primary prophylaxis is advocated to prevent the occurrence of symptomatic acute spontaneous haemarthroses and to preserve joint structure and function. Typically, twice or thrice weekly infusions of factor VIII or IX concentrates are integral to this treatment approach. Secondary prophylaxis is initiated after the relentless cycle of progressive joint damage has been triggered by prior haemarthroses and is intended to preserve existing joint health by preventing additional spontaneous bleeding events. Event-driven prophylaxis involves the administration of clotting factor concentrates to prevent acute traumatic bleeds, which are anticipated to occur in association with surgical or physical trauma. This regimen enhances the effectiveness of primary or secondary prophylaxis protocols or on-demand approaches to replacement therapy. Besides the marked reduction in the so-called annual bleed rate, prophylaxis regimens frequently increase personal self-confidence to embark on a more active and physical lifestyle; however, in reality, prophylaxis must be individualized in accordance with bleeding phenotypes, with the unique pharmacokinetic profile of administered replacement clotting factor concentrates, with the specific clinical scenario, and with the degree of intensity anticipated for any physical activity. The introduction of extended half-life replacement products will also influence how these prophylaxis regimens will be accomplished. The following scenarios will discuss how prophylaxis regimens can be implemented to protect the individual from developing spontaneous and activity-induced acute bleeding complications and to maintain an improved quality of life.', ""Prophylaxis has been established as the treatment of choice in children with haemophilia and its continuation into the adult years has been shown to decrease morbidity throughout life. The cost of factor therapy has made the option questionable in cost-effectiveness studies. The role of prophylaxis in pharmacokinetic dosage and tolerization against inhibitor formation were used to model the cost utility of prophylaxis vs. on-demand (OD) therapy over a lifetime horizon in severe haemophilia A. The model was applied to a single provider national health system exemplified by the United Kingdom's National Health Service and a third party provider in the United States. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated and compared to threshold values used by payer agencies to guide reimbursement decisions. A cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was also estimated for Sweden. Prophylaxis was dominant over OD treatment in the UK. The model resulted in an ICER - $68\xa0000 - within the range of treatments reimbursed in the USA. In Sweden, a cost/QALY of SEK 1.1 million was also within the range of reimbursed treatments in that country. Dosage- and treatment-induced inhibitor incidence were the most important variables in the model. Subject to continuing clinical evidence of the effectiveness of pharmacokinetic dosage and the role of prophylaxis in decreasing inhibitor incidence, treatment for life with prophylaxis is a cost-effective therapy, using current criteria for the reimbursement of health care technologies in a number of countries."", ""Prophylaxis is the recommended treatment for people with severe haemophilia. It is unlikely that a single prophylactic regimen, for example based on weight, would be optimal for all patients and therefore each individual should have a personalized regimen, agreed between themselves and their haemophilia centre. This regimen should take into account the individual's bleeding pattern, the condition of their musculoskeletal system, level and timing of physical activity and measurement of coagulation factor in their blood. It is important to recognize that prophylactic regimens are likely to need to change with time as the circumstances of an individual change. For example, activity may change with age or with the season and an individual's factor VIII pharmacokinetics vary with age. Knowledge of a patient's pharmacokinetics is likely to help personalize prophylaxis when combined with other information. Factor VIII pharmacokinetics are simple to measure in routine clinical practice and can be adequately calculated from 2 to 3 blood samples combined with a simple to use computer program. Prophylaxis is expensive and, in countries with a limited health care budget, ways to improve its cost effectiveness need to be considered to allow increased access to this treatment. For example, increasing the frequency of prophylaxis can dramatically reduce the amount of treatment required to sustain measureable factor levels and hence reduce cost. The introduction of longer-acting coagulation factors may necessitate a change in concepts about prophylaxis because whilst these agents may sustain an apparently adequate trough level with fewer infusions, the length of time a person spends at a low level will be increased and this could increase the risk of bleeding, especially at the time of increased physical activity. There is convincing evidence that prophylaxis is the optimal therapy for severe haemophilia, optimizing treatment for each individual and increasing access to this treatment modality are important goals for the future.""]","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/28302350.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/24762285.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/23534877.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/22726096.txt']",How is prophylaxis administered?,"Prophylaxis is typically administered through twice or thrice weekly infusions of factor VIII or IX concentrates.

"['On-demand therapy enables stopping haemorrhages rapidly, reducing joint pain and restoring joint mobility, but does not prevent the beginning and subsequent development of haemophilic arthropathy. The main objective of this study was to identify the clinical and orthopaedic status of severe haemophilic patients with bleeding phenotype receiving on-demand treatment in Spain. We conducted an epidemiological, observational, retrospective study, recruiting 167 patients from 36 centres (92% of them with haemophilia A), median age at enrolment of 35 years. Forty per cent of the patients received a combination of on-demand and short-term prophylaxis regimen; the rest was under on-demand treatment. One hundred and forty-five patients (87%) reported at least one bleeding episode and 22 (13%) of the biologically severe patients had no bleeding phenotype. Seventy-one per cent of the studied population presented established haemophilic arthropathy, reaching 80% if we exclude patients without bleeding phenotype. Forty-three per cent of these patients had one or two joints affected, 28% of them had three or four affected joints, 20% reported five or six affected joints and 9% more than six injured joints. An increase in established haemophilic arthropathy with age was observed. Forty-six patients underwent orthopaedic surgery at least once. These data show that on-demand therapy is not effective in preventing the development of haemophilic arthropathy in severe haemophilic population with bleeding phenotype. Therefore, we suggest that the optimal treatment in these patients should be based on prophylaxis. We recommend analysing the reasons for ending prophylaxis, in case its reinstatement should be necessary.', 'The optimal treatment of hemophilia has been evolving since the advent of factor VIII concentrates, continues to vary geographically, and remains a source of debate. There now exists an extensive clinical literature that demonstrates clear benefits of prophylaxis for patients with hemophiliaA compared to on-demand treatment, including a reduction in the number of bleeding episodes, improved joint function, and greater patient well-being. However, the value of these benefits must be weighed against the heavier economic burden of increased factor use. This paper reviews the literature that compares the benefits of prophylaxis with that of on-demand treatment, compares varying prophylaxis dose and administration frequency protocols, and considers the long-term cost-benefit of prophylactic therapy.', 'Rapid expansion of therapeutic options have increased the complexity of hemophilia care. Previously, on-demand therapy aimed to reduce morbidity and early mortality; however, now aggressive prophylaxis, particularly in children, encourages an active lifestyle. Accurate diagnosis, recognition of early threats to musculoskeletal health, and optimization of therapy are critical for both males and females affected by hemophilia. The diversity of emerging hemophilia therapies, from modified factor protein concentrates, to gene therapy, to nonfactor hemostatic strategies, provide an exciting opportunity to target unmet needs in the bleeding disorder community.', ""Clotting factor replacement therapy has a major impact on the quality of life in patients with haemophilia. To analyse and compare the outcomes of on-demand and prophylactic treatment regimens in child- and adulthood, a self-evaluation questionnaire was sent to 182 patients over 30 years of age with severe haemophilia A or B. Analysis of the questionnaire results revealed that most study participants had been treated on-demand in childhood, but that the majority of these patients subsequently switched to prophylaxis. However, of those patients who began with prophylaxis as children, the vast majority maintained prophylactic treatment as adults. Inhibitor development was reported significantly more frequently by patients who started with on-demand treatment than by those who started with prophylaxis. In the year prior to completing the questionnaire, adults with severe haemophilia who received prophylactic treatment reported a significantly lower incidence of bleeding as a result of more frequent factor consumption. These results are in close accordance with published prospective data. Although nearly all patients with severe haemophilia had joint pain due to bleeding, those who had always had prophylactic treatment reported superior outcomes in terms of the need for joint replacement, walking speed and distance, participation in school sports and further education. These data clearly underline the superiority of prophylactic treatment for the majority of individuals with severe haemophilia. The worst outcomes were found in those treated on-demand in childhood who later switched to prophylaxis.

Recent data from a handful of patients who have undergone gene therapy for hemophilia B are very encouraging with a sustained factor IX (FIX) level of 0.05 IU/mL maintained for over 4 years. While this level is above the current usual target trough levels, it falls well short of the level that patients on prophylaxis with longer-acting products can expect. Prophylaxis is also associated with high peak levels, which permits patients to maintain an active lifestyle. A major barrier to widespread adoption of gene therapy is a high seroprevalence of antibodies to adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors in the general population. Young children would be the best candidates for gene therapy in view of much lower seroprevalence to AAV in infants.

Transgenic FIX expression has remained stable at ∼5% of normal in the high-dose cohort over a 7-year follow-up period, resulting in a substantial reduction in spontaneous bleeding and FIX protein usage without toxicity. This study has been followed by unparalleled advances in gene therapy for hemophilia A and B, leading to clotting factor activity approaching normal or near-normal levels associated with a ""zero bleed rates"" in previously severely affected patients following a single administration of AAV vectors. Thus, AAV gene therapies are likely to alter the treatment paradigm for hemophilia A and B. This review explores recent progress and the remaining limitations that need to be overcome for wider availability of this novel treatment of inherited bleeding disorders.', 'After numerous preclinical studies demonstrated consistent success in large and small animal models, gene therapy has finally seen initial signs of clinically meaningful success. In a landmark study, Nathwani and colleagues reported sustained factor (F)IX expression in individuals with severe hemophilia B following adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated in vivo FIX gene transfer. As the next possible treatment-changing paradigm in hemophilia care, gene therapy may provide patients with sufficient hemostatic improvement to achieve the World Federation of Hemophilia\'s aspirational goal of ""integration of opportunities in all aspects of life… equivalent to someone without a bleeding disorder."" Although promising momentum supports the potential of gene therapy to replace protein-based therapeutics for hemophilia, several obstacles remain. The largest challenges appear to be overcoming the cellular immune responses to the AAV capsid; preexisting AAV neutralizing antibodies, which immediately exclude approximately 50% of the target population; and the ability to scale-up vector manufacturing for widespread applicability.

"['Gene therapy has the potential to revolutionise treatment for patients with haemophilia and is close to entering clinical practice. While factor concentrates have improved outcomes, individuals still face a lifetime of injections, pain, progressive joint damage, the potential for inhibitor development and impaired quality of life. Recently published studies in adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene therapy have demonstrated improvement in endogenous factor levels over sustained periods, significant reduction in annualised bleed rates, lower exogenous factor usage and thus far a positive safety profile. In making the shared decision to proceed with gene therapy for haemophilia, physicians should make it clear that research is ongoing and that there are remaining evidence gaps, such as long-term safety profiles and duration of treatment effect. The eligibility criteria for gene therapy trials mean that key patient groups may be excluded, eg children/adolescents, those with liver or kidney dysfunction and those with a prior history of factor inhibitors or pre-existing neutralising AAV antibodies. Gene therapy offers a life-changing opportunity for patients to reduce their bleeding risk while also reducing or abrogating the need for exogenous factor administration. Given the expanding evidence base, both physicians and patients will need sources of clear and reliable information to be able to discuss and judge the risks and benefits of treatment.', 'Gene therapy has recently become a realistic treatment perspective for patients with hemophilia. Reviewing the literature and our personal experience from clinical trials, we discuss key aspects of hemophilia A and B gene therapy with vectors derived from adeno-associated virus, including predictable results, risks, adverse events, and patient-reported outcomes. Patient selection, informed consent, administration, and monitoring of gene therapy as well as data collection are explained. We also discuss the need for interdisciplinary cooperation with hepatology and other specialties. We emphasize structural and organizational requirements for treatment centers according to the hub-and-spoke model and recommend the use of electronic diaries to ensure safe and timely collection and exchange of data. Electronic diaries will play a key role as a primary source of data for pharmacovigilance, postmarketing clinical studies, national and international registries, as well as health technology and benefit assessment. Reimbursement aspects and the future of gene therapy in adolescents and children are also considered. In a rapidly evolving scientific environment, these recommendations aim to support treatment providers and payers to prepare for the implementation of gene therapy following marketing authorization.', 'Gene therapy for hemophilia A has fallen short of success despite several clinical trials conducted over the past decade. Challenges to its success include vector immunogenicity, insufficient transgene expression levels of Factor VIII, and inhibitor antibody formation. Gene therapy has been dominated by the use of viral vectors, as well as the immunogenic and oncogenic concerns that accompany these strategies. Because of the complexity of viral vectors, the development of nonviral DNA delivery methods may provide an efficient and safe alternative for the treatment of hemophilia A. New types of nonviral strategies, such as DNA integrating vectors, and the success of several nonviral animal studies, suggest that nonviral gene therapy has curative potential and justifies its clinical development.', 'After numerous preclinical studies demonstrated consistent success in large and small animal models, gene therapy has finally seen initial signs of clinically meaningful success.

"['Hemophilia is a congenital hemorrhagic disease caused by genetic abnormalities in coagulation factor VIII or factor IX. Current conventional therapy to prevent bleeding requires frequent intravenous injections of coagulation factor concentrates from early childhood. Accordingly, gene therapy for hemophilia remains an exciting future prospect for patients and their families, due to its potential to cure the disease through a one-time treatment. After a series of successes in basic research, recent clinical trials have demonstrated clear efficacy of gene therapy for hemophilia using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Although this is likely to alter the paradigm of hemophilia care in the near future, it will be important to overcome immune responses against AAV. Gene therapy for hemophilia cannot be given to patients with anti-AAV capsid-neutralizing antibodies, and cellular immunity with CD8(+) T cells should be controlled for sustained expression. Furthermore, long-term therapeutic effects should be closely observed because of the failure of the AAV vector genome to replicate during cell division. This review focuses on the basis of gene therapy, current successes of clinical trials, and the future direction of hemophilia gene therapy.', 'After numerous preclinical studies demonstrated consistent success in large and small animal models, gene therapy has finally seen initial signs of clinically meaningful success.

This review discusses the relevance of gene therapy to the hemophilia disease state, previous research progress, the current landscape of clinical trials, and considerations for promoting the future availability of gene therapy for hemophilia.', 'Gene therapy is the only novel technology that currently offers the prospect of a lasting cure for hemophilia and freedom from the burden of repeated injections. Recent data from a handful of patients who have undergone gene therapy for hemophilia B are very encouraging with a sustained factor IX (FIX) level of 0.05 IU/mL maintained for over 4 years. While this level is above the current usual target trough levels, it falls well short of the level that patients on prophylaxis with longer-acting products can expect. Prophylaxis is also associated with high peak levels, which permits patients to maintain an active lifestyle. A major barrier to widespread adoption of gene therapy is a high seroprevalence of antibodies to adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors in the general population. Young children would be the best candidates for gene therapy in view of much lower seroprevalence to AAV in infants. A stable level of FIX early in life would prevent the onset of joint bleeds and the development of arthropathy. The recent experience with apolipoprotein tiparvovec (Glybera; uniQure, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) indicates that gene therapy is unlikely to prove to be a cheap therapeutic option. It is also quite possible that other new technologies that do not require viral vectors (such as stem cell therapy) may overtake gene therapy during development and make it redundant.', 'Since the middle of the last century, there have been amazing therapeutic advances for hemophilia such as the development of plasma-derived products and bioengineered recombinant factors VIII and IX (for hemophilia A and B, respectively) with improved stability, higher activity, and extended half-life. The recent use of a monoclonal antibody that mimics factor VIII activity (which is an efficient treatment for all hemophilia A phenotypes with or without inhibitors) has shown the great possibilities of non-factor therapies for improving the quality of life of hemophilia A patients, with a safer application and long-lasting effects. Gene therapy offers the promise of a ""true cure"" for hemophilia based on the permanent effect that a gene edition may render. Clinical trials developed in the last decade based on adenoviral vectors show modest but consistent results; now, CRISPR/Cas technology (which is considered the most efficient tool for gene edition) is being developed on different hemophilia models. Once the off-target risks are solved and an efficient switch on/off for Cas activity is developed, this strategy might become the most feasible option for gene therapy in hemophilia and other monogenic diseases.']","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/30083852.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/26805907.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/27148842.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/35314527.txt']",What is the future of gene therapy for hemophilia?,"Gene therapy for hemophilia is seen as a promising future prospect for patients and their families, as it has the potential to cure the disease through a one-time treatment.

METHODS: Data from 777 patients with hemophilia A who were registered in the National Health Insurance Research Database between 1998 and 2008 were analyzed using SAS 9.0. RESULTS: Musculoskeletal or nervous system-related surgical procedures and clotting factor VIII concentrate costs were identified as factors affecting rehabilitation usage; musculoskeletal or nervous system-related surgical procedures (odds ratio = 3.788; P < 0.001) were the most important predictor of whether a patient with hemophilia A would use rehabilitation services. Joint disorders, arthropathies, bone and cartilage disorders, intracranial hemorrhage, and brain trauma were common diagnoses during rehabilitation use. The costs of physical therapy (physiotherapy) comprised the majority (71.2%) of rehabilitation therapy categories. Increasingly, rehabilitation therapy was performed at physician clinics. The total rehabilitation costs were <0.1% of the total annual medical costs. CONCLUSION: Musculoskeletal or nervous system-related surgical procedures and increased use of clotting factor VIII concentrate affect the rehabilitation utilization of patients with hemophilia A the most. The findings in this study could help clinicians comprehensively understand the rehabilitation utilization of patients with hemophilia A.']","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/19134033.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/11122394.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/35868453.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/27690229.txt']",What is the role of occupational therapy in hemophilia?,"Rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary approach which includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychology, social work and technical applications like prostheses, orthoses (splints and braces), shoe adaptations, walking aids and adaptations in the house and work situation, but also education.

"['Treatment of haemophilia patients with inhibitors against factor VIII/IX (FVIII/IX) is still challenging and recurrent haemarthroses cause arthropathy with associated restrictions on participation in physical activities and sports. Rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary approach which includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychology, social work and technical applications like prostheses, orthoses (splints and braces), shoe adaptations, walking aids and adaptations in the house and work situation, but also education. The theoretical principles and practical advice regarding rehabilitation and physiotherapy for both children and adults with haemophilia without inhibitors are highly applicable for patients with inhibitors. Hydrotherapy is useful in the treatment of painful or stiff joints and/or muscles after an acute haemarthrosis, muscle bleeds and chronic arthropathy. In addition, it is of use in cases of chronic synovitis and to start mobilization after long periods of bed rest or during the weaning of a splint. In cases of bleeding and arthropathy, adequate treatment of pain is very important, as are functional exercises. Everyone should be physically active for 30-60 min day(-1). Participation in sports is recommended for people with haemophilia, the best sport being swimming. Children should participate in sports appropriate to their size and physical characteristics.', 'BACKGROUND: Prior research has established that falls are commonplace in adults with hemophilia, and advises that physical therapy and exercise are successful in fall prevention. Recognizing obstacles and catalysts to physical therapy and exercise in people with hemophilia may augment the efficacy of efforts to prevent falls in this population. OBJECTIVES: To learn about the experiences and ideas of patients with hemophilia, especially associated with balance, falls, and exercise. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 14 adult patients with hemophilia were performed. The interviews were coded for themes founded on the study aims. RESULTS: Most subjects described difficulty with balance, often ascribed to joint problems. They believed that staying strong and fit could positively influence balance, but expressed concerns and fear related to falling. Those who exercised regularly did not view exercise as hazardous, while those who did not dependably exercise articulated worry that dangers of exercise may offset the benefits. The most common obstacle to exercise was pain and having someone to exercise with was often described as an enabler. Barriers to partaking in physical therapy included weak proof of its success and distrust in the therapist. Positive physical therapy experiences in the past and the connection with the therapist were reported as facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: People with hemophilia describe some attitudes and experiences that are unique to hemophilia while others are found in the general population. Attending to fear, pain, and support for interventions, while encouraging a robust therapeutic alliance and a plan for routine exercise may aid fall prevention behaviors.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of different physical therapy interventions that could validate decisions taken by health care providers in the field of rehabilitation of patients with hemophilia according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), including body functions and structures, activity, and participation. DATA SOURCES: Seven databases-PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Google Scholar, and Clinicaltrials.gov-were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating any physical therapy modality to manage hemophilia. STUDY SELECTION: After abstract and full-text filtration, a methodological quality assessment was performed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for the studies that met the eligibility criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant data were extracted from eligible studies and outcomes were categorized according to the ICF. DATA SYNTHESIS: Using Review Manager and Microsoft Excel, a quantitative analysis using standardized mean differences with the 95% confidence interval was completed. Statistical heterogeneity between studies was explored using the I(2) test. A fixed effect model was applied to all data analyses. If heterogeneity was statistically significant, the Der Simonian and Laird random effects models were used instead. RESULTS: 35 randomized controlled trials with 1216 participants were included in this systematic review; 13 of them dealt with pediatric patients. Most of the studies were of good quality; 12 studies were of low quality. Meta-analysis showed a significant difference in favor of manual therapy, laser, and therapeutic exercises on selected outcomes of body function and structure, activity, and participation categories of the ICF model. CONCLUSION: This systematic review recommends using manual therapy and therapeutic exercise modalities to improve join health status in combination with educational sessions to improve the quality of life of patients with hemophilic arthropathy. For pediatric patients with hemophilic arthropathy, using laser therapy is promising for improving functional capacity.', 'Sixteen subjects with hemophilia A of levels 1-5 stage of joint damage were tested over a 6-week period to evaluate the efficacy of functional foot orthoses. The level of ankle bleeds (hemarthrosis) before and after the intervention with functional foot orthoses was determined by evaluating pain, disability, and activity levels. All subjects reported a significant reduction of ankle bleeds coinciding with the intervention of functional foot orthoses. The use of a foot-pain disability measure clearly showed significant reduction in the level of pain experienced by the subjects and in their overall index score. However, the disability and activity index scores showed no significant improvement after the intervention with orthoses. This finding would support the use of functional foot orthoses to treat patients with hemophilia A, as significant reduction in pain levels appears to greatly improve the lives of the patients.']","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/19134033.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/30046715.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/35868453.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/11359888.txt']",How does occupational therapy help people with hemophilia?,"Occupational therapy is part of a multidisciplinary approach to rehabilitation for people with hemophilia, which also includes physiotherapy, psychology, social work, and technical applications like prostheses and orthoses.

"[""The roles of nurses in 16 orthopaedic joint corrections of 14 haemophilia A patients (eight severe, six moderate) are described. The patients' ages ranged from 10 to 37 years with a mean age of 17 years and 4 months. The nursing tasks could be divided into three stages. The first is preoperation, the nurse acting as care provider on a team of experts involved in planning the corrective surgery for the affected joints; and as a counsellor for preparing the patients and family members to cope with the challenging operation. The second is intraoperation, the nurse having the role of care provider, giving factor concentrate either by bolus injection (seven episodes) or continuous infusion (nine episodes). The third is postoperation, as a comprehensive care provider, giving cryoprecipitate and/or factor concentrate and monitoring bleeding doses, and as a trainer, teaching the patients how to dissolve blood components and self-venepuncture with aseptic technique. Home treatment for early bleeding was given for 11 episodes, while 6-month prophylaxis was given for five. The accomplishment of these different roles required good communication and nurturing skills, a well-adjusted personality and a warm and positive attitude. The successful performance of nursing roles allows the haemophiliac patients to have a near-normal quality of life."", 'Rapid expansion of therapeutic options have increased the complexity of hemophilia care. Previously, on-demand therapy aimed to reduce morbidity and early mortality; however, now aggressive prophylaxis, particularly in children, encourages an active lifestyle. Accurate diagnosis, recognition of early threats to musculoskeletal health, and optimization of therapy are critical for both males and females affected by hemophilia. The diversity of emerging hemophilia therapies, from modified factor protein concentrates, to gene therapy, to nonfactor hemostatic strategies, provide an exciting opportunity to target unmet needs in the bleeding disorder community.', 'Care for children with severe hemophilia has moved from pediatric hospital wards and rehabilitation services to the home, school, and community. Advances in hemophilia are due largely to the development of specialized hemophilia treatment centers, which created a system of comprehensive care and focused healthcare efforts on prevention and education. Parallel advances in coagulation resulted in identification of clotting factors VIII and IX, elucidation of the protein molecular and biochemical structures and functions, sequencing of their respective genes and transfer of the human genes for production of proteins by recombinant technology, and development of gene therapy. The tragedy of the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C raised awareness in patients as well as healthcare providers of the vulnerability of blood products to viral contamination and spurred progress in science leading to viral inactivation of purified proteins. Concomitantly, physicians treating bleeding episodes in the clinic investigated pharmacokinetics and pharmacoeconomics of various strategies of clotting factor replacement. The observation that trough factor levels as low as 1 to 2% were adequate to prevent most bleeding episodes led to current prophylactic regimens that allow boys to participate fully in school and community activities while factor concentrate is infused at home on a regular schedule. Currently, children with hemophilia look forward to a normal life expectancy and excellent health-related quality of life. Physician and community partnerships through research and advocacy societies have accelerated clinical advancements as well as extension of treatment to developing countries. The future of hemophilia promises a cure with gene therapy. Given the past accomplishments in hemophilia, a long-term solution to replacement of the genetically deficient protein lies on the horizon.', ""Haemophilia is a rare and complex disorder and its successful management will depend upon the establishment of a network of 'comprehensive care' including the services of haematologists, orthopaedic surgeons, rheumatologists, dental surgeons, physiotherapists, specialised nurses and counsellors. One of the major lessons to be learned from the HIV epidemic in haemophilia is that it is critical to strive to obtain the safest and purest forms of blood products for these patients.

We outline the Evolving Treatment of Hemophilia's Impact on Neurodevelopment, Intelligence, and Other Cognitive Functions (NCT03660774) study, which aims to meet this need."", 'CONTEXT: As life expectancy in individuals with congenital hemophilia approaches that of the general population, we hypothesize that public health risks, including overweight and obesity, also follow a similar trend. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search of the literature included terms relating to overweight, sequelae of being overweight, and hemophilia. Studies were included if they reported the frequency or clinical significance of known complications of overweight and obesity, including musculoskeletal disease, aerobic capacity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, decreased quality of life, and change in pharmacokinetics of infused clotting factor in hemophilia. Recommendations from medical organizations were searched for preventive and management strategies applicable to this population. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overweight and obesity are now more prevalent in the hemophilia population than previous generations, with rates similar to and, in certain subsets even higher, than that of the general population. Increased BMI leads to limitations in joint range of motion in the general population and even more so in persons with hemophilia. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity in hemophilia are an increasing problem. Simple steps can be taken to encourage patients to decrease caloric intake and increase physical activity. Prevention and management of overweight, obesity, and their sequelae must be addressed in clinical practice in order to maximize the overall health of the hemophilia population.', 'Obesity is a major health concern not only in the general population but also in patients with haemophilia. Little is known about the consequences of obesity for haemophilia patients. As obesity is an important risk factor for osteoarthritis, these effects may be even more pronounced in haemophilia patients who are prone to joint damage. The association between obesity and limitations in daily activities as well as the frequency of bleeds and use of factor VIII (FVIII) concentrate in obese and normal weight haemophilia patients was assessed. Fifteen obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg m(-2)) and fifteen normal weight (BMI ≤ 25 kg m(-2)) haemophilia A patients matched for severity and age were analysed. The Hemophilia Activities List (HAL) was used to assess the impairment in daily activities. Compared with the normal weight haemophilia patients, obese haemophiliacs had a significantly lower sum score (88/100 and 98/100, respectively, P = 0.02), which was mainly caused by an impaired lower limb function. All other components of the HAL also showed lower scores in the obese patients, but did not reach statistical significance. A higher frequency of bleeds requiring treatment with FVIII concentrate occurred in the obese haemophiliacs (17 bleeds in eight individuals) compared with the controls (three bleeds in three individuals) (P = 0.045). Compared with non-obese haemophilia patients, obese haemophiliacs had more joint bleeds and a lower overall HAL score, which was driven by a lower limb function score. Prevention of overweight and weight reduction requires special attention from physicians treating haemophilia patients.', 'Hemophilia is characterized by genetic mutations resulting in the deficiency of factors critical to the normal process of coagulation, sometimes resulting in spontaneous bleeding into soft tissue, joints, and internal organs. The 2 most common subtypes are hemophilia A, or factor VIII deficiency, and hemophilia B, or factor IX deficiency. Hemophilia affects an estimated 20,000 individuals in the United States. The diagnosis and management of patients with severe hemophilia is complex, and requires preventive treatment (prophylaxis) to avoid bleeding episodes and related complications and the use of replacement therapy with coagulation factors during acute bleeding episodes. To achieve optimal long-term results, the treatment of patients with hemophilia requires a comprehensive approach coordinated by a multidisciplinary team of specialists. Hemophilia imposes a substantial burden from economic, societal, and patient perspectives.']","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/31595670.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/22099360.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/21332881.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/26168206.txt']",How does nutrition affect hemophilia?,"Overweight and obesity are becoming more prevalent in the hemophilia population and can lead to limitations in joint range of motion, which is especially problematic for individuals with hemophilia who are prone to joint damage.

The circumstances during the first exposures of factor VIII concentrates in hemophilia A may have an impact on the risk of developing inhibitors.

Treatment is started when the boys are 1-2 years of age, the regimens used being 24-40 IU F VIII kg-1 three times weekly in haemophilia-A cases (i.e. greater than 2000 IU kg-1 annually) and 25-40 IU F IX kg-1 twice weekly in haemophilia-B cases. The orthopaedic and radiological joint scores (maximum scores of 90 and 78, respectively) are evaluated as recommended by the World Federation of Haemophilia. Of those subjects aged 3-17 years, 29 out of 35 individuals had joint scores of zero. The oldest group had only minor joint defects. The VIII:C and IX:C concentrations had usually not fallen below 1% of normal. All 60 patients are able to lead normal lives.

Originally described by the Finish physician Erik von Willebrand in 1926 this disorder is associated with mucous membran bleeding including epistaxis, hypermenorhoea and excessive bleeding from surgery and dental procedures. In von Willebrands disease the patients have a quantitative or qualitative abnormality in the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) which has two major functions: it serves by bridging between platelets and injury site in the blood vessel wall, and it circulates as a complex with factor VIII, protecting it from rapid degradation. More than 20 different types and subtypes of vWD have been described but almost all patients can be classified as having 1 of the 2 most common types of vWD. About 70 % of patients have type 1 and about 10-20 % present themself with type 2A and 2B vWD type 3 in about 10 %. By taking a clinical history of bleeding it is important to think about vWD and to make the appropriate diagnosis. If the vWD is suspected diagnostic tests should include an activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, factor VIII:C, Ristocetin cofactor, and vWF antigen. Additional testing of ristocetin induced plattlet adhesion (RIPA), the multimeric structure and collagen binding test and gen-analysis allow diagnosing the different types of v. Willebrand Disease. The treatment of choice in mild forms is the synthetic agent desmopressin. In patients with severe type 1, type 2B, 2N and type 3 or in people who do not response to desmopressin, the appropriate treatment is a factor VIII concentrate that is rich of vWF.

The reaction is started by addition of a reagent containing factor XIa, thrombin, CaCl2, and phospholipids. Then factor XIa activates factor IX if present, thrombin activates factor VIII, and subsequently the complete factor X activating complex (factor IXa, factor VIIIa, Ca ions, and phospholipids) rapidly activates factor X. Finally, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plus a chromogenic substrate are added to stop the reaction and to measure formed factor Xa. Factor Xa formation is proportional to the plasma factor IX concentration (from 0 to 140%). The two reagents needed for the assay are stable at room temperature during a whole working day and for 3 h at 37 degrees C. A new isolation procedure for factor VIII is described.

The method has been simplified through the combination of the bovine factors IXa + X, phospholipid and calcium chloride into one reagent. A further improvement was obtained by generating F Xa to a stable plateau level, thus minimizing influences from variations in time and temperature. The substrate hydrolysis was terminated with 1 M citrate buffer, pH 3.0, which reduced the environmental effects as compared to acetic acid. Overall a fourfold reduction in reagent consumption was achieved.

"['Hemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a reduced level of factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) in blood. Bleeding episodes may occur spontaneously in the severe form of hemophilia or after trauma in the milder forms. It is important that patients are diagnosed correctly, which includes placing them into the correct severity category of the disorder so that appropriate treatment can be given. Diagnosis is made by determination of the amount of FVIII:C in the blood, usually using a one-stage factor VIII:C assay. However, approximately one third of patients with mild or moderate hemophilia will have much lower results by the chromogenic assay, with some of them having normal results by the one-stage assay.

"['The ability to monitor Factor VIII (FVIII) and Factor IX (FIX) levels is integral to the clinical management of hemophilia A and B patients, respectively. Factor activity levels are checked during regular follow-up, post-infusion of factor concentrates, during pre- and post-operative assessments, and when the presence of an inhibitor is suspected. However, the ability to accurately and reproducibly measure factor activity levels with standard coagulation assays has been challenging due to the emergence of recombinant factor concentrates with extended half-lives. Similarly, special considerations must be given to the type of inhibitor assay used in patients with acquired hemophilia receiving recombinant porcine FVIII replacement. Alternative approaches to achieve hemostasis with clotting factor mimetics and interference of endogenous anticoagulants lack standardized assays for monitoring hemostatic efficacy. Laboratory assays measuring dynamic clotting parameters such as thrombin generation or whole blood viscoelasticity may provide a way forward, but have yet to enter routine clinical use. This review highlights the role of specialized coagulation assays in an era where multiple new hemostatic therapeutics for hemophilia are available, and underscores the need for clear communication between bedside and laboratory clinicians.', 'Laboratories monitor hemophilia replacement therapy by specific coagulation factor measurement before and after the infusion of human-derived or recombinant factors. Bypassing agents are now used for patients with inhibitors. Recently, modified long-acting coagulation factors have been introduced, for which discrepant results may be expected when the measurement is performed with one-stage clotting or chromogenic assays. Currently, novel drugs not based on coagulation factors are being developed and\xa0further tested in clinical studies. These drugs do require new methods, and therefore, laboratory evaluation of hemophilia will undergo dramatic changes in the near future. Accordingly, present laboratory methods for monitoring, which include one-stage clotting or chromogenic assays, used to measure either factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), will not be sufficient. A thrombin generation test (TGT) or thromboelastometry may be used to monitor bypassing agents. For measuring modified long-acting coagulation factors, chromogenic assays will be probably more suitable than one-stage clotting assays. Novel drugs that are not based on coagulation factors, such as emicizumab, fitusiran, or concizumab,\xa0will require alternative methods.', 'The advent of extended half-life (EHL) recombinant clotting factors and innovative non-factor replacement therapeutics, such as emicizumab, offers several advantages over existing products for the prophylactic treatment of people living with hemophilia (PwH). These include low annual bleeding rates with less frequent dosing, higher trough plasma concentrations, and a more convenient route of administration. However, increasing use of these therapies poses challenges to clinicians and coagulation laboratories due to the lack of standardized assays for monitoring of hemostatic parameters, and the potential for misinterpretation of test results, which may jeopardize patient safety. Definitive diagnosis of hemophilia and treatment monitoring is reliant on demonstrating factor VIII (FVIII; hemophilia A) or factor IX (FIX; hemophilia B) deficiency using a functional coagulation assay. The most frequently used assays are based on activated partial thromboplastin time, using a one-stage or two-stage process. While one-stage and chromogenic assays have performed well with human-derived FVIII and FIX and full-length recombinant products, EHL recombinant factors are heterogeneous in structure and mode of action and therefore show wide variation in activity levels between different one-stage assays, and between one-stage and chromogenic assays. In the context of the recommended stepwise approach for laboratory diagnosis of hemophilia, we examine the diagnostic challenges associated with the use of EHL factors and novel non-factor therapeutics and consider the optimal diagnostic approach in PwH who are receiving these treatments. Ultimately, accurate diagnostic solutions are a prerequisite for personalized therapy to minimize treatment burden and improve quality of life in PwH.', 'Treatment of haemophilia A/B patients comprises factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) concentrate replacement therapy, respectively.

"['BACKGROUND: Recently, the in vitro bleeding time test (IVBT) was proved to be a very sensitive screening method for the detection of vWD, showing rather good correlation between the closure time and the level of vWF. The vWF levels have been found to be significantly lower in healthy humans who are group O than in those who belong to the other ABO blood groups (non-group O). The aim of this study was to detect whether these differences in vWF levels in normal persons correspond to differences in nonvascular primary hemostasis when investigated by the IVBT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Healthy blood donors (n = 162) without evidence of hemostatic disorders, without ingestion of drugs for at least 2 weeks, and with normal in vivo bleeding time endpoints, normal factor VIII clotting activity levels, normal structure of vWF multimers, and normal ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation were examined by IVBT. IVBT was performed with two automated systems (Thrombostat 4000, VDG [TST]; and a platelet function analyzer (PFA-100, Dade Behring [PFA]). CaCl2 and ADP were used as aggregants for the two TST tests (TST-CaCl2 and TST-ADP), and ADP- or epinephrine (Epi)-coated membranes were used with the two PFA tests (PFA-ADP and PFA-Epi). RESULTS: Closure time in the IVBT significantly correlated with the blood groups, but in reverse order (as did blood volume; data not shown): TST-ADP (mean +/- SD): group O, 89 +/- 14.6 seconds versus non-group O, 82 +/- 13 seconds (p<0.01); TST-CaCl(2): group O, 154 +/- 28.9 seconds versus non-group O, 140 +/- 31.3 seconds (p<0.01); PFA-ADP: group O, 91 +/- 13.4 seconds versus non-group O, 86 +/- 11.9 seconds (p<0.05); PFA-Epi: group O, 112 +/- 15.4 seconds versus non-group O, 104 +/- 16.7 seconds (p<0.05). Donors with vWF < or =77.5 % had longer closure time than those with vWF >77.5 % (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Significant ABO-group-specific differences in nonvascular primary hemostasis could be found by IVBT. The differences are small, however, and lie within the normal range. Whether these differences have any biologic relevance can only be speculated.', ""30 members of an Illinois kindred were studied with a battery of haemostatic tests including the template bleeding time, platelet retention by glass beads (PRGB), measurement of activities related to factor VIII, and crossed-immunoelectrophoresis (CIEP). 9 family members had a history of excessive bleeding, and all 9 had prolonged bleeding times and increased migration of their factor VIII-related antigen (VIIIR:Ag) on CIEP. Of the other tests performed, the VIII:Ristocetin Cofactor and the PRGB showed the best correlation with the bleeding time. 3 subjects who were not bleeders, but who came from a branch of the family where there were several affected members, also had an abnormal VIIIR:Ag. The pattern of inheritance of the altered VIIIR:Ag in this family was one of autosomal dominance with full penetrance. The CIEP is a valuable screening test for the detection of variant von Willebrand's disease and the recognition of silent heterozygotes."", ""The authors simultaneously performed the Ivy (IBT) and the Simplate I (SBT) bleeding time in 17 volunteers with classic hemophilia A to determine whether a prolonged Simplate bleeding time was indeed indicative of impaired primary hemostasis, as has been postulated recently, or whether the technic itself accounted for the observed changes. They also assessed platelet function and Factor VIII-related activities on blood drawn that day. The SBT was prolonged in 11 patients, while the IBT was consistently normal. The platelet aggregation studies and the levels of Factor VIII-related antigen (VIII R:Ag) and ristocetin cofactor (VIII R:Rc) were normal, providing no evidence of von Willebrand's disease. The patients with a prolonged SBT were all younger than 20 years of age, bled two to three times more often than those with a normal SBT, and consumed more Factor VIII concentrate. A prolonged SBT with depressed VIII:C therefore is not indicative of von Willebrand's disease but is shared by a substantial proportion of hemophiliacs, who may be a greater risk of bleeding."", ""Of 49 patients with hemophilia A or B, who had not received replacement transfusions for at least 72 hours, ten were demonstrated to have a prolonged value for the bleeding time.

Conventional techniques for detecting hemophilia are based on clotting factor tests such as hemostasis assays to determine various types of hemophilia and its severity. In the current study, we propose a new approach involving a spectral technique to discriminate normal controls from hemophilia patients with an accuracy above 80 %. This accuracy is calculated on the normalized relative intensity based on the light measurement of blood components by analyzing a certain set of fluorescent bio molecules. Our results indicated that Red Blood Cells (RBCs) show lower porphyrin content and enzyme deficiencies in hemophilia patients than in normal controls.

In addition, the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time are used for monitoring anticoagulant therapy with heparin and warfarin, respectively.

However, interpreting the results of coagulation assays is not always straightforward, and expert consultation is occasionally required to resolve difficult clinical situations.', 'This report describes the development of microplate-based blood coagulation assays. The assays require a kinetic microplate reader to follow changes in absorbance at 405 nm caused by the coagulating plasma. Procedures for performing prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time tests are described with intra- and inter-assay variability of a few percentage points. The prothrombin time of normal plasma was 64.5 +/- 3.6 s, and the activated partial thromboplastin time was 69.8 +/- 3.2 s. Clotting times were prolonged when normal plasma was mixed with plasmas deficient in particular coagulation factors, as expected. These assays take advantage of the microplate format (small sample size and multiple simultaneous assays) and can be customized for specific purposes, such as quantifying purified factor IX or assessing protein C activity in plasma.', 'The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is the most common coagulation test procedure performed in routine laboratories, apart from the prothrombin time. The test is traditionally used for identifying quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation, monitoring anticoagulant therapy with unfractionated heparin, and detecting inhibitors of blood coagulation, the most common of which is the lupus anticoagulant. Whereas short APTT values have been mostly overlooked in the past, recent evidence suggests that these might be associated with hypercoagulability. Although clinical relevance is yet to be clearly defined, hypercoagulability detected by a shortened APTT appears to be significantly associated with a major risk of venous thromboembolism independently from other variables such as blood group, the presence of inherited thrombophilia, and factor VIII levels. This novel finding suggests that this traditional, simple, and inexpensive test might have renewed utility along with traditional thrombophilic tests in the evaluation of venous thromboembolic risk. In addition, APTT waveform analysis is also providing mounting evidence of added utility, in particular for identifying sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in critically ill patients (particularly where this might worsen the prognosis), for monitoring therapy in patients with inhibitors, and as a diagnostic aid to identify patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. In total, such emerging evidence suggests that the APTT is either an old dogma displaying new tricks or else might describe a new dogma for an old laboratory trick.', 'A lot of attempts have been made to standardise both activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT). Only the standardization of PT has been successfully implemented while the standardization of APTT is still underway. The PT test is a common method for monitoring oral anticoagulant therapy. Owing to the variable response of the thromboplastins and the different ways of reporting, PT results obtained from patients treated with oral anticoagulants have not been interchangeable between laboratories. In 1977, the World Health Organization (WHO) designed a batch of human brain thromboplastin as the first international reference preparation (IRP) for thromboplastin and a calibration system was proposed in 1982, based on the assumption that a linear relationship exists between the logarithm of the PT obtained with the IRP and test thromboplastins. This calibration model is used to standardize the reporting of the PT by converting the PT ratio observed with the local thromboplastin into an International Normalized Ratio (INR). The INR system is being adopted by an increasing number of hospitals in many countries. With the increasing use of the INR system, a number of problems have been identified with the INR system. The most serious one is that the ISI of a thromboplastin depends on the coagulometer used. Besides, a number of investigators have noted that the ISI value provided by the manufacturer for each new batch of thromboplastin reagent may be incorrect and the use of inappropriate control plasma can lead to erroneous INR calculations. Four solutions have been proposed to solve the problems of the INR system as follows: (a) the local system calibration with lyophilized plasma calibrants with assigned manual PT determined in terms of the relevant IRP for thromboplastin; (b) the use of a mean normal prothrombin time (MNPT) obtained with the coagulometer to derive the prothrombin ratio: (c) PT standardization by means of the procedure using plasma calibrants: and (d) selection of sensitive thromboplastin with low ISI values. The INR system has been adopted in Thailand since 1984. There are 3 steps in the implementation as follows: (a) preparation of National Reference Thromboplastin; (b) selection of high sensitive thromboplastin; and (c) optimal therapeutic range for Thai patients. The anticoagulant effect of heparin is usually monitored by the APTT, a test that is sensitive to the inhibitory effects of heparin on thrombin, factor Xa. and factor IXa. However, the type of clot detection system, the contact activator; and the phospholipid composition of the reagent affect the APTT response. In 1995. ISTH/ICSH proposed a calibration model for APTT standardization. As the problem showed a great similarity to PT standardization, the same model of calibration was applied but no international reference preparation for the APTT is yet available. In 1998. van den Besselaar et al proposed a lyophilized APTT reagent comprising synthetic phospholipids and colloidal silica as a candidate IRP for the APTT.']","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/20855988.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/1389175.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/19085761.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/10926265.txt']",What is a prothrombin time test?,"A prothrombin time test is a coagulation test that reflects levels of prothrombin and FV, FVII, and FX.

"['Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is a laboratory test for the diagnosis of blood coagulation disorders. The test consists of two stages: The first one is the preincubation of a plasma sample with negatively charged materials (kaolin, ellagic acid etc.) to activate factors XII and XI; the second stage begins after the addition of calcium ions that triggers a chain of calcium-dependent enzymatic reactions resulting in fibrinogen clotting. Mathematical modeling was used for the analysis of the APTT test. The process of coagulation was described by a set of coupled differential equations that were solved by the numerical method. It was found that as little as 2.3 x 10(-9) microM of factor XIIa (1/10000 of its plasma concentration) is enough to cause the complete activation of factor XII and prekallikrein (PK) during the first 20 s of the preincubation phase. By the end of this phase, kallikrein (K) is completely inhibited, residual activity of factor XIIa is 54%, and factor XI is activated by 26%.

Satisfactory fetal plasma samples were obtained in 80 instances and the diagnosis--or exclusion--of hemophilia was made by immunoradiometric assay of the factor VIII coagulant protein (VIII:CAg). The accuracy of the diagnosis established by fetoscopy has been verified after delivery or termination, and there have been no misdiagnoses resulting from laboratory error. Additional evidence for the accuracy of the analysis was the observation that the frequency of hemophilia in pregnancies of obligate carriers of the hemophilia gene, and of women whose plasma assays were indicative of the carrier state, was 29 of 59 fetuses at risk. In one case of cross-reacting material-positive hemophilia, samples obtained at fetoscopy and from the newborn infant had normal VIII:CAg levels but the infant had decreased factor VIII procoagulant activity. There were five fetal deaths resulting from fetoscopy in 55 pregnancies not intentionally terminated. Although only a small percentage of pregnant hemophilia carriers in the United States have elected to undergo fetoscopy for prenatal diagnosis, this procedure has allowed a number of pregnancies to go to term with delivery of normal males in families that were not willing to accept the risk of a hemophilic child. In eight instances, fetoscopic evaluation was sought for two successive pregnancies.', 'Prenatal diagnosis of haemophilia A or B is possible by means of chorionic villus biopsy in the first trimester which traces the mutation or informative genetic markers. If possible, direct gene analysis of the mutation is preferred. The natural starting point in haemophilia A is to ascertain whether the disease is due to inversion in the X-chromosome, which is the case in almost half of the severe cases. In haemophilia B, most families carry a unique mutation which needs to be characterized. In the immediate future, much of the prenatal diagnosis will be based on indirect genetic markers, repeats or polymorphisms, of the F.VIII and IX genes. Today chorionic villus sampling is the most widely used method but amniotic fluid, fetal blood and pre-implantation genetic diagnostics can also be used in selected cases. Prenatal diagnosis must be preceded by adequate genetic counselling and risk assessment of the potential carrier and subsequent support during the diagnostic process.', 'Cloned factor VIII deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) sequences were used as probes in the prenatal diagnosis of haemophilia A. Fetal DNA from cultured amniotic fluid cells was examined for a DNA polymorphism within the factor VIII gene which marked the haemophilia A gene in the pregnant obligate carrier. The fetus was predicted to be an affected male, and the diagnosis of haemophilia A was confirmed both in utero and after termination of the pregnancy.', 'First-trimester prenatal diagnoses of hemophilia A were heretofore obtained by using either intragenic factor VIII markers or linked extragenic polymorphic markers. Postulating that the combined use of all the available intragenic and extragenic markers can render such diagnoses more frequently feasible and more reliable, we carried out ten first-trimester prenatal diagnoses in male fetuses at risk for hemophilia A by DNA analysis of chorionic villus employing in combination the intragenic Bcl I polymorphism and the St 14 (DXS 52) or DX 13 (DXS 15) extragenic probes. A diagnosis of hemophilia was obtained in three fetuses, with a diagnosis of normal fetus obtained in the remaining seven. Seven diagnoses are confirmed by factor VIII assays carried out at the time of abortion, in the mid-trimester or at birth. A factor VIII probe recognizing Bcl I polymorphism was useful in 4 of 6 diagnoses; St 14, in 5 of 6; and DX 13 in 3 of 5. In two cases, St 14 was the only useful probe for diagnosis. Even though no recombination between extragenic probes and factor VIII gene was detected in this study, when only extragenic markers were informative we advised diagnostic confirmation on fetal plasma obtained by fetoscopy. Hence, first-trimester prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia A is feasible for the great majority of fetuses at risk through combined use of all the available intragenic and extragenic probes, providing key family members are available.']","['/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/3922454.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/8800503.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/2861360.txt', '/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/experiments/hemophilia/datasets/abstracts/3127923.txt']",How is an ultrasound scan used in the diagnosis of hemophilia?,The context does not provide information on how an ultrasound scan is used in the diagnosis of hemophilia.,"I'm sorry, I cannot answer the question as there is no context provided about the use of ultrasound scan in the diagnosis of hemophilia.",gpt3.5_turbo,abstracts,chroma
