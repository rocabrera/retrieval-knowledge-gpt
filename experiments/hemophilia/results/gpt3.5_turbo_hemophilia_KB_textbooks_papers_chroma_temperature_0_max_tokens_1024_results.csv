Von Willebrand disease is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a protein that plays a crucial role in the clotting process. VWF helps platelets stick together and adhere to the site of injury, promoting clot formation. Therefore, individuals with von Willebrand disease may experience prolonged bleeding, particularly from mucous membranes and after minor injuries.

Hemophilia, on the other hand, is a genetic disorder that primarily affects males. It is characterized by a deficiency or absence of specific clotting factors, either factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B). These clotting factors are essential for the formation of a stable blood clot. As a result, individuals with hemophilia may experience spontaneous bleeding into joints, muscles, or other internal organs, as well as prolonged bleeding after injuries.
