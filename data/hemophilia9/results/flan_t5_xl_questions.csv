"Hemophilia A (classic hemophilia) is an hereditary coagulation disorder characterized by the absence, severe deficiency, or defective functioning of plasma coagulation factor VIII. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner and occurs almost exclusively in males. The first manifestations of bleeding are usually first noted as a young child since most of the patients with hemophilia A have a profound deficiency of factor VIII (less than 1% of normal value). However, in mild hemophilia (5-25% of normal level of factor VIII) the condition may escape detection with many of the patients developing bleeding only after trauma or surgery. Hemophilia A is the result of a recent genetic mutation in approximately one third of patients, for whom often there is no family history of a bleeding disorder. Here we present an elderly male patient with spontaneous bleeding in an extremity that has coagulation studies consistent with the diagnosis of hemophilia A. Physicians must be aware that mild hemophilia can present in this unusual manner and should consider this possibility in patients that have unexplained bleeding even if there is no clear personal or family history of an hereditary coagulation disorder.",/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/data/hemophilia9/datasets/hemophilia9.txt,What it is hemophilia?,"an hereditary coagulation disorder characterized by the absence, severe deficiency",a disease in which the body does not produce enough red blood cells
"Haemophilia A is caused by a broad range of mutations in the factor VIII (FVIII) gene. The most frequent of them is a large inversion, which appears to be the underlying defect in approximately 45% of all severely affected patients (FVIII < or = 1%). The results here are of 84 unrelated Slovak haemophilia A cases. The factor VIII inversion was identified in 22 of 44 (50%) patients with severe haemophilia A and in 1 of 13 patients with moderately severe disease. The inversions of distal type were more frequent (82.6%) than proximal ones (17.4%).",/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/data/hemophilia9/datasets/hemophilia9.txt,How many factors of hemophilia are there?,3,There are two factors of hemophilia.
"The treatment of hemophilia and conditions that frequently afflict hemophilic patients, such as arthropathy, HIV infection, and viral hepatitis, are discussed. Long-term prophylaxis with Factor VIII or IX is very successful at preventing disabling arthropathy. Much research is being done on gene therapy and prolonged periods of Factor VIII and IX expression have already been achieved in animals. In HIV-seropositive hemophilic patients the CD4 count appears to decline more slowly in patients treated with higher purity than with lower-purity products. Thermoresistant non-lipid-enveloped viruses, such as parvovirus, do not become inactivated by the currently used virucidal methods.",/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/data/hemophilia9/datasets/hemophilia9.txt,which are the treatments for hemophilia,Long-term prophylaxis with Factor VIII or IX,"Hemophilia treatments include bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow as"
