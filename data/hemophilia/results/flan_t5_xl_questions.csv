"Hemophilia, which means love (philia) of blood (hemo), manifests with prolonged and excessive bleeding either spontaneously or after insignificant trauma. Hemophilia encompasses a group of inherited ailments that alter the body's normal blood coagulation. A hereditary hemorrhagic disorder resulting from congenital deficit or scarcity of factor VIII, hemophilia A, which is known as classical hemophilia, manifests as protracted and excessive bleeding either spontaneously or secondary to trauma.",/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/data/hemophilia/datasets/hemophilia.txt,what it is hemophilia?,A hereditary hemorrhagic disorder resulting from congenital deficit or,a disease
"INTRODUCTION: Hemophilia A (HA) has an X-linked pattern of inheritance and is the most common of the hemorrhagic disorders. HA is caused by a decreased or deficiency of the functional clotting factor VIII (FVIII) and effects 1 in 5000-10,000 male births. The common treatment for hemophilia is replacement therapy by plasma-derived or recombinant FVIII. Approximately 20-30% of people with a severe type of HA develop an inhibitor and this phenomenon is the main challenge in the management of these patients. Genetic factors and environmental determinants contribute to inhibitor development. Here, the roles of various genetic and environmental factors such as the type of FVIII concentrate used, the number of exposure days, and peak treatment time will be discussed in detail. It seems this information is helpful for hematologists. AREAS COVERED: A literature review was done in January 2016 on PubMed and Scopus using the following keywords:' h(a)emophilia A & factor VIII inhibitor', 'h(a)emophilia A & factor VIII alloantibody', 'h(a)emophilia A & inhibitor'. There was no time limitation; however, there was an English language limitation placed on the articles selected. Expert commentary: Influential genetic and environmental factors in developing inhibitors have been discussed. Most of the risk factors are related to previously untreated patients with hemophili.",/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/data/hemophilia/datasets/hemophilia.txt,List all hemophilia factors,Factor VIII,"Hemophilia A, Hemophilia B, Hemophilia"
"New therapies for hemophilia A and hemophilia B will likely continue to change clinical practice. Ranging from extended half-life to nonfactor products and gene therapy, these innovative approaches have the potential to enhance the standard of care by decreasing infusion frequency to increase compliance, promoting prophylaxis, offering alternatives to inhibitor patients, and easing route of administration. Each category has intrinsic challenges that may limit the broader application of these promising therapies. To date, none specifically address the challenge of dispersing treatment to the developing world.",/home/rocabrera/Desktop/retrieval-knowledge-gpt/data/hemophilia/datasets/hemophilia.txt,which are the treatments for hemophilia,"extended half-life long acting factor concentrates, subcutaneous non-replacement therapies and","Hemophilia treatments include bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow as"
