Optimal care for severe haemophilia includes accurate diagnosis, early and adequate factor replacement for bleeding episodes, and the provision of prophylaxis from an early age to prevent joint bleeding and the consequent arthropathy.

Minor joint bleedings are treated by adequate factor substitution, temporarily non-weight bearing of the extremity, application of ice-packs and physical therapy. More severe joint hemorrhages should be aspirated in order to reduce the acute synovitis. This is followed by a consequent physical therapy (joint and soft tissue techniques) and anti-inflammatory drugs. The chronic synovitis is less painful and poorly responses to conservative interventions. Local ice application, systemic and local anti-inflammatory treatment support the physical therapy. Soft heel shock absorber, elastic and semi-rigid bandages prevent recurrent bleeding episodes by shock absorption and decrease of synovial impingement. Synovectomy is indicated in cases of chronic persistent synovitis. Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO), which is an alternative in certain cases, has been performed with great success in some hospitals.

      "With retrieval:\n",
      "Von Willebrand disease is diagnosed through a complete evaluation including von Willebrand factor multimers, ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation, factor VIII activity level, and a template bleeding time. Clinical information and laboratory data are necessary for the diagnosis because of the overlap of normal and abnormal laboratory values. Recent advances in characterizing and measuring the factor VIII complex have greatly improved the diagnosis of the variant forms of von Willebrand's disease. Diagnosis of VWD requires both clinical and laboratory assessment, and testing should comprise FVIII:C, vWF:Ag and either/or both vWF:RCof and vWF:CBA. Laboratory results should be reviewed in the light of clinical findings, and confirmatory repeat testing should be performed on a sample taken 6 weeks later.\n",

      "The treatment for von Willebrand disease depends on the type and severity of the disease. Desmopressin is the treatment of choice for Type 1 von Willebrand's disease, while plasma concentrates containing factor VIII and von Willebrand factor are necessary for Type 3 and severe forms of Type 1 and 2. Platelet concentrates or desmopressin can be used as adjunctive treatments when poor correction of the bleeding time is associated with continued bleeding. In some cases, antifibrinolytics or recombinant factor VIIa may be used. High-dose intravenous gamma-globulin has also been shown to be effective in some cases of acquired von Willebrand's disease. Dosage and timing of treatments should be carefully planned to avoid thrombotic events and maintain appropriate FVIII levels.\n",

Desmopressin is the treatment of choice in patients with Type 1 von Willebrand's disease, while plasma concentrates containing factor VIII and von Willebrand factor are necessary for Type 3 and the majority of Type 2 patients. Recent advances in care have allowed for secondary long-term prophylaxis with von Willebrand factor-containing concentrates, and interdisciplinary management and close patient monitoring can yield positive outcomes in surgical prophylaxis. Diagnosis can be difficult, and specific guidelines for heavy bleeders requiring short- and long-term prophylaxis are lacking. Treatment options include antifibrinolytics, desmopressin, von Willebrand factor/factor VIII concentrates, and recombinant factor VIIa in intractable bleeding circumstances.\n",

      "Factor assays are used to monitor hemophilia treatment by measuring factor activity levels before and after the infusion of factor concentrates, during regular follow-up, pre- and post-operative assessments, and when the presence of an inhibitor is suspected. However, the emergence of recombinant factor concentrates with extended half-lives and non-factor replacement therapeutics has made it challenging to accurately and reproducibly measure factor activity levels with standard coagulation assays. Alternative approaches such as thrombin generation or whole blood viscoelasticity assays may provide a way forward, but have yet to enter routine clinical use. Clear communication between bedside and laboratory clinicians is necessary for accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment of hemophilia patients.\n",

It involves preincubating a plasma sample with negatively charged materials to activate certain factors, followed by the addition of calcium ions to trigger a chain of enzymatic reactions resulting in fibrinogen clotting. The test is used to identify abnormalities in the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation, monitor anticoagulant therapy, and detect inhibitors of blood coagulation. It is also used to identify hypercoagulability and assess the risk of venous thromboembolism. The test is sensitive to all hemostatic factors except FVII and is used in conjunction with the prothrombin time to identify various coagulopathies. Microplate-based blood coagulation assays have been developed to perform the APTT test and can be customized for specific purposes.\n",
