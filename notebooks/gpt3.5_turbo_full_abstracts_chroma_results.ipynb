Hemophilia is inherited in a monogenic form, but the clinical features can be influenced by other genetic factors. Genetic analysis is widely applied in inherited bleeding disorders to allow genetic counseling of affected families and help find a link between the genotype and the phenotype.\n",

Optimal care for severe haemophilia includes accurate diagnosis, early and adequate factor replacement for bleeding episodes and the provision of prophylaxis from an early age to prevent joint bleeding and the consequent arthropathy. The delivery of a high quality comprehensive service to patients with bleeding disorders depends upon defined standards and a network of haemophilia centres in the UK with similar models in other countries. In developing countries, development of local expertise results in an improved outlook and reduction in mortality.\n",

However, severe and moderate hemophilia are rare in females. Females with hemophilia may go undiagnosed for years because the most common symptoms also occur in females without hemophilia.

In Norway, boys with hemophilia usually begin treatment after their first bleeding episode, while in Sweden, prophylactic treatment is started when the boys are 1-2 years of age. Treatment involves administering factor concentrate, and parents usually start treating their children at home when they are around 4 years old.
