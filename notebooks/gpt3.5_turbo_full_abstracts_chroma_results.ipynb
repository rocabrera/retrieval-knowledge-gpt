It is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor, a protein that helps platelets stick together and form clots.

      "Von Willebrand disease is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or defect in the von Willebrand factor, a protein required for platelet adherence to injured vessel walls. It is characterized by spontaneous bleeding from mucous membranes, excessive bleeding from wounds, and menorrhagia. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring von Willebrand factor activity and antigen levels, factor VIII activity, and performing a multimer analysis of von Willebrand factor. Treatment may require plasma-derived concentrates, but can often be accomplished with DDAVP, a vasopressin analogue that causes transient release of von Willebrand factor from body storage sites.\n",

While this treatment has shown promise in early clinical trials, there are still potential risks associated with gene therapy for hemophilia.

      "Von Willebrand disease is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or defect in the von Willebrand factor, which is needed for platelets to adhere to a damaged vessel wall. It typically presents with bleeding from mucosal surfaces and can be diagnosed by measuring von Willebrand factor activity and antigen levels, factor VIII activity, and performing a multimer analysis of von Willebrand factor. Treatment may require plasma-derived concentrates or DDAVP, a vasopressin analogue that causes transient release of von Willebrand factor from body storage sites.\n",

      "Von Willebrand disease is a bleeding disorder that affects both males and females, while hemophilia is a genetic disorder that primarily affects males. Von Willebrand disease is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor, while hemophilia is caused by a deficiency of either clotting factor VIII (hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (hemophilia B). Von Willebrand disease can cause bleeding from mucous membranes and can lead to excessive bleeding during surgery or after injury. Hemophilia primarily causes bleeding into joints and muscles, which can lead to joint damage and chronic pain.\n",

      "Von Willebrand disease is different from hemophilia in terms of the most common types of surgery required. While surgery for hemophilia is typically for joint deformities and contractures, surgery for von Willebrand disease is usually general surgery due to massive bleeding from mucous membranes. Additionally, the primary defects in hemophilia are related to clotting factors, while in von Willebrand disease it is a deficiency or defect in the von Willebrand factor.\n",

Diagnosis of VWD requires both clinical and laboratory assessment, and testing should comprise FVIII:C, vWF:Ag and either/or both vWF:RCof and vWF:CBA. Laboratory results should be reviewed in the light of clinical findings, and confirmatory repeat testing should be performed on a sample taken 6 weeks later.\n",

Recent advances in care have allowed for most patients to be managed adequately, and long-term prophylaxis with von Willebrand factor-containing concentrates can control recurrent bleeding even in the more severe forms. Diagnosis can be difficult and selecting the optimal product and regimen is necessary for effective therapy. Orthopaedic surgery in patients with von Willebrand's disease can be undertaken without excessive bleeding when there is close collaboration between the surgeon and haemostaseologist.

The chromogenic factor VIII assay is recommended for the diagnosis of mild hemophilia A. For carrier states and post-infusion monitoring, both one-stage and chromogenic factor assays may be used. The use of factor VIII-related antigen and the ristocetin cofactor assays can increase the reliability of diagnosis in patients with hemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease, and in carriers of hemophilia A.\n",

      "Factor assay is used to measure factor activity levels before and after infusion of factor concentrates, during pre- and post-operative assessments, and when the presence of an inhibitor is suspected in the clinical management of hemophilia A and B patients. However, the emergence of recombinant factor concentrates with extended half-lives and non-factor replacement therapeutics poses challenges to clinicians and coagulation laboratories due to the lack of standardized assays for monitoring of hemostatic parameters, and the potential for misinterpretation of test results, which may jeopardize patient safety. One-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based clotting or two-stage chromogenic factor activity assays are commonly used for diagnostic and monitoring purposes, but they have strengths and limitations, and efficient communication between clinical and laboratory staff is crucial to ensure the most appropriate assay is used for each clinical situation.\n",
